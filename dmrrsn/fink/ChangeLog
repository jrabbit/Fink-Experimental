	* packages: renamed to 10.1

	* 10.2: new directory, containing essential packages for 10.2

	* bootstrap.pl: now defines $distribution to be 10.1 or 10.2 based on 
	  config.guess output and records value in fink.conf, sets up 
	  "packages" as a symlink to the $distribution directory during 
	  bootstrapping, and sets up "dists" as a symlink to the $distribution
	  directory upon installation

	* postinstall.pl.in: new postinstall script for Fink which modifies
	  an old-style Fink installation (with the "dists" directory) to
	  a new-style Fink installation (in which "dists" is a symlink to
	  the $distribution directory).  Works in 10.1 or 10.2.  Does the 
	  Right Thing if CVS is already being used (compatible with the new 
	  SelfUpdate.pm)

	* fink.info.in: adds PostInstScript

	* inject.pl: adds an sed command for fink.info.in to handle the
	  PostInstScript, includes postinstall.pl.in in the Fink tarball

	* install.sh: installs postinstall.pl in $basepath/lib/fink/

	* setup.sh: processes postinstall.pl.in to postinstall.pl

2001-09-11  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* fink.in: Use methods of FinkVersion if possible.

	local/bootstrap. Runs the scanpackages command at the end of
	bootstrap. Final message reworded after a suggestion from Tom
	Sobczynski.
	* inject.pl: Use the modules from the perlmod directory. Changed
	stable/bootstrap to local/bootstrap. Adds local/bootstrap to
	fink.conf if required.
