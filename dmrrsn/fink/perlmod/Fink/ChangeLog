2002-09-08  Dave Morrison <dmrrsn@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Config.pm: adds $distribution (read from the config file) as
	  an exported item

	* SelfUpdate.pm: now checks out the "dists" CVS module rather
	  than the "packages" one (still as the "fink" directory).  
	  This contains a "10.2" subdirectory.  Users using 10.1 also 
	  get a second checkout: "packages/dists" is checked out as 
	  "fink/10.1".

	* Validation.pm: added the new "gcc" field
	
2002-08-21  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Engine.pm: Fixed "fink remove" command

2002-08-19  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Engine.pm, PkgVersion.pm: Changed the data path for "fink remove" a bit

	* Engine.pm, PkgVersion.pm: Patch #596239 (fink splitoff install changes)
	  incorporated, improves splitoff handling

	* Validation.pm: Added JarFiles and TarFilesRename fields.

2002-08-11  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm: Enhanced how the Files field (in splitoffs) is handled:
	  if the given path starts with a slash, we treat it as relative to %d/%D
	  otherwise as relative to %i/%I (as we do currently anyway).
	
	* Services.pm: Fix for bug #545155 (it was possible to cause infinite
	  recursion during percent expansion).

2002-08-10  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* SelfUpdate.pm: Only force a second rebuild of the package database, and 
	  also only restart Fink if the package manager is being updated.

2002-08-05  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Engine.pm (cmd_cleanup): Improved the "fink cleanup" command to also clean
	  files in /sw/src (only files not directories - removing directories in 
	  /sw/src is dangerous as it can interupt running builds etc.)

	* Mirror.pm: Don't use mirror timestamp as a mirror (Bug #563182).

2002-08-04  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Config.pm, Configure.pm: Fixed verbosity level selection.

	* PkgVersion.pm: Patch #588476 (Java support) by Sylvain Cuaz.

	* Fixed bug #548373 (package DB read thrice). It is not only read twice
	  (the new package manager may support new features, and thus must rebuild
	  the database once more)

	* Engine.pm: Patch #588705: Automates passing on the options
	  (by Sylvain Cuaz)

2002-08-03  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Services.pm: Fixed read_properties_multival, it was broken by the
	  RuntimeVars patch.

	* PkgVersion.pm, Services.pm: Patch #579210: RuntimeVars field added
	  (thanks to Sylvain Cuaz for this)

2002-07-31  Justin F. Hallett  <thesin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Small fix to Configure.pm for the verbosity level selection,
	  which was reported not working. Should be fine now.

2002-07-28  Justin F. Hallett  <thesin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added /sbin and /usr/sbin to the clean env since some pkgs need
	  stuff like chown or chmod to install properly.

2002-07-26  Justin F. Hallett  <thesin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Changed spacing in fink list easier to use with awk or cut
	* added a space before pkg list for better seperation of info

2002-07-26  Justin F. Hallett  <thesin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Services.pm: Fix for the Jag Argument "M-?M-^?M-X" isn't numeric
	  in numeric eq (==) at /sw/lib/perl5/Fink/Engine.pm line 330, <SW_VERS>
	  line 2. Bug.  But COLUMNS needs to bet exported in init.{csh, sh}

2002-07-25  Justin F. Hallett  <thesin@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Services.pm: Temp Fix for the Jag Argument "M-?M-^?M-X" isn't numeric
	  in numeric eq (==) at /sw/lib/perl5/Fink/Engine.pm line 330, <SW_VERS>
	  line 2. Bug.  Need better fix in future, maybe read $ENV{COLUMNS}

2002-07-25  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>
	
	* PkgVersion.pm: Fixed Bootstrap (use /usr/bin/gnutar if %p/bin/tar is missing)

	* Engine.pm: Little fix that ensures Fink runs even if not on a terminal.
	
2002-07-24  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Incorporated patch #504498 by Justin F. Hallett which adds the
	  TarFilesRename and TarNFilesRename field.

	* Incorporated patch #577882 by Sylvain Cuaz which cleans the environment 
	before building packages.

2002-07-22  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	option to turn off the package cacher temporarily.
	
	* SelfUpdate.pm (finish): Include apt-shlibs in the list of packags that are
	updated upon a selfupdate.

2002-05-28  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	characters occuring in filenames passed to this function.

2002-05-28  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

2002-05-27  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Validation.pm: Accept Source-MD5/SourceN-MD5 as legal fields.

2002-05-26  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Engine.pm (do_real_list): Fixed bug that occured when output of 'fink list'
	was not going to a terminal and --width=auto was specified.

2002-05-25  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm: Added Source-MD5/SourceN-MD5 fields.

	* Services.pm: Added file_MD5_checksum function.

	error instead of a warning.

2002-05-05  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm (enable_bootstrap, disable_bootstrap): fixed for splitoffs
	(thanks to Sylvain Cuaz for this patch).

2002-05-04  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* SelfUpdate.pm (do_tarball): Replaced prdownloads URL with mirror 'sourceforge'.

2002-05-02  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm (resolve_depends): Fixed bug that made building splitoffs that 
	depend on their master impossible (affects kdebase package).

2002-05-01  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm (get_description): Don't display DescPort and DescPackaging,
	they are unimportant for the avarage user and developers must look at the
	.info file anyway.

2002-04-25  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Engine.pm (real_install): Fixed bug #546315

2002-04-19  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* all: updated copyright notice.

2002-03-31  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Package.pm: Now works again if the Storable perl module is not installed.

2002-03-31  Finlay Dobbie <finlayd@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Package.pm: Added support for caching of info files.
        
	* Engine.pm: Added an index command to update the cache.
        
	* SelfUpdate.pm (do_finish): added hook to update package cache.
        
2002-03-26  Justin F. Hallett <thesin@southofheaven.net>

        * PkgVersion.pm: Fixed Type: perl to install the execs into
        the proper dir and not directly into BASEPATH.

2002-03-21  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm: added get_tree function
	
	* NetAccess.pm (download_cmd): Added another download method, "axel"
	(thanks to Alexander Strange)

2002-03-19  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Config.pm (initialize): No macosx pseudo package if we are not on
	Mac OS X!

	* Status.pm (initialize): Fixed macosx version detection on Darwin
	(obviously there is no Mac OS X version on a pure Darwin system)

2002-03-16  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>
	
	* PkgVersion.pm (resolve_depends): Yet another attempt to fix splitoff
	build dependencies, hopefully more succesful this time.

2002-03-16 Dave Morrison <dmrrsn@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Validation.pm: Added "SplitOff" to the list of known fields, and 
	parsing for SplitOff2-SplitOff9

	* Engine.pm: When fink prompts users for a decision about a
	dependency, it now displays the Descriptions of the packages involved
	in the decision.

2002-03-16  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>
	
	* Validation.pm: Added "BuildDependsOnly" to the list of known fields
	
	* PkgVersion.pm (resolve_depends): Fixed this so that splitoffs and
	splitoff masters always return the same (correct) build dependencies.
	
	* PkgVersion.pm (add_splitoff): Removed annoying debug output ("Found a
	splitoff")
		
	* Services.pm (read_properties_lines): Handle nested heredocs
	correctly, and if errors are encountered, once more output the
	affected filename.

2002-03-13  Peter O'Gorman <ogorman@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Engine.pm (do_real_list): Don't read package info first, wait and
	see if it is needed. Fixed a mistake in the help text.

2002-03-13  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm (phase_build): Fix so that root-dirs of splitoffs are
	properly removed again.

2002-03-13  Peter O'Gorman <ogorman@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Engine.pm: Support for options in apropos and list commands.

	* Services.pm: Added a get_term_width function.

2002-03-09  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Engine.pm (cmd_apropos): Fixed apropos commands for strings like "gtk+"

2002-03-07  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Engine.pm (real_install): Fix to make rebuilding splitoffs and splitoff
	master packages work correctly.

	* PkgVersion.pm (initialize): Expand percents in even more fields now:
	Suggests, Enhances, Recommends and Pre-Depends.
	(expand_percent_if_available): First converts field parameter to lower case.
	(phase_install): Fixed some issues with the Files field, and changed the
	order in which it is processed (now comes before DocFiles, not after)

2002-03-06  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm: Multitude of changes, implementing initial splitoff 
	support. Percent expansion is now done in all dependency related fields.

	* Package.pm (inject_description): Return the created PkgVersion object
	to the called. Used by splitoff code

	* Services.pm (read_properties): Split this function, creating two new
	called read_properties_var and read_properties_lines, which take a text
	variable / a list of strings, instead of a file. Used by splitoff code.

2002-02-23  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* NetAccess.pm (fetch_url_to_file, download_cmd): Allow the user to
	resume partial downloads.
	
	* NetAccess.pm (download_cmd): Added 'DownloadMethod' field to fink.conf
	(thanks to Christian Swinehart).

	* NetAccess.pm (download_cmd): If we use curl, make sure it treats 
	error 404 properly, i.e. fail instead of downloading the error page
	(thanks to Joseph Bauer).

	* Engine.pm (, cmd_fetch_allcmd_fetch_all_missing): keep going even if a
	single file could not be downloaded. (thanks to Randal L. Schwartz). 

2002-02-01  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Validation.pm: deb file validator now warns if files are installed
	outside of /sw.

2002-01-27  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Validation.pm: Warn on unknown licenses.

2002-01-26  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* *.pm: Changed to use new is_verbose() function to determine verbosity
	
	* Config.pm (is_verbose): New function, returns true if verbose mode is on

	* Validation.pm: Only be verbose in verbose mode

	* Validation.pm: Warn on missing license field

2002-01-11  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* FinkVersion.pm.in: If /sw/fink/VERSION is missing, now tries to look
	at the old /sw/etc/fink-release file instead.

2002-01-10  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* FinkVersion.pm.in: moved fink-release from /sw/etc to /sw/fink and
	renamed it to VERSION to match with other modules

	* SelfUpdate.pm: fixed selfupdate, it would hang when trying to
	uncompress the package tar ball.

2002-01-05  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Validation.pm: fixed stupid mistake

	* Validation.pm: Added /sw/lib/locale to list of deprecated directories;
	added some new fields to list of allowed fields (not yet used)

2001-12-28  Matthias Neeracher <neeracher@mac.com>

	* Package.pm: Added %package_hash which speeds up some operations
	enormously.

2001-12-27  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Config.pm: Added $darwin_version and $macosx_version, reflecting
	the kernel/system versions.

	* Status.pm (initialize): Added pseudo packages 'darwin' and 'macosx'
	which can be used for dependencies on specific kernel/system versions.

2001-12-23  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm (phase_install): Fixed bug occuring when removing the
	last 'perl' type package using UpdatePOD.

2001-12-21  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm, Package.pm: Allow '+' in package names.

2001-12-20  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* SelfUpdate.pm (do_direct_cvs): Fixed CVS updating for core developers
	(CVS_RSH now always is set to 'ssh').

2001-12-12  Justin F. Hallett  <thesin@southofheaven.net>

	* PkgVersion.pm: Added UpdatePOD field, and added value "Perl" for
	the "type" field to better support perl packages

2001-12-11  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Engine.pm (cmd_remove): All packages to be removed are now passed
	at once to dpkg, thus taking advantage of the advanced dependency
	resolving mechanism of dpkg.

2001-12-02  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm: Added percent expansion for SourceRename fields

2001-11-06  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* Engine.pm (process): Get rid of the funky "Done." message.

2001-11-04  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* SelfUpdate.pm (setup_direct_cvs): Made the File::Find routine
	more robust. Should be able to handle exotic file names now.

2001-11-02  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* SelfUpdate.pm: Major rewrite. Now gives the user the choice
	between tracking point releases (the usual packages-#.#.#.tar.gz
	procedure) and setting up direct CVS updating.
	* Engine.pm: Added a selfupdate-cvs command.

2001-11-01  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* Mirror.pm (new_from_field): Disabled the case for leaving out
	the key in custom mirror lists; it doesn't work anyway because the
	URLs themselves also contain colons. We'll need another separator.

2001-10-27  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm (resolve_depends): Make "package not found"
	non-fatal if there are alternatives.

2001-10-20  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* Engine.pm (real_install): Let the user pick one alternative when
	resolving dependencies with virtual packages.

2001-10-18  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* Engine.pm (restart_as_root): Propagate the "--yes" option when
	restarting as root.

	* Services.pm (prompt, prompt_boolean, prompt_selection): Check
	the "dontask" a.k.a. "--yes" option and use the default value
	instead of prompting the user when set.

	* Config.pm: Added infrastructure to propagate command line
	options: set_options() and get_option().

	* Engine.pm (process): Be more helpful when the user entered an
	unknown command (contributed by Justin Hallett).

2001-10-17  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* Mirror.pm: New class that handles both named and package-local
	mirror site lists. Retrying is handled more intelligently.
	* NetAccess.pm: Another major overhaul. Handling of mirrors has
	been moved to the new Mirror class. That greatly simplified the
	fetch_url_to_file routine.
	* PkgVersion.pm: Use the new Mirror class to handle package-local
	mirrors. The mirror list is parsed on the fly when it is needed.

	* Engine.pm (process): Added a "this command needs root
	privileges" flag. Minor restructuring.
	(restart_as_root): New function which re-executes fink as root,
	passing the current command. Now knows about su if configured.

	* FinkVersion.pm.in: Made independent of Fink::Config. The
	installation path is now hardcoded during installation, like with
	fink.in.

2001-10-14  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* Services.pm (version_cmp): Hopefully get it right this
	time. dpkg implicitly separates version and revision before
	comparing them. As a result the change to fink's comparison
	function that should fix openssh's version ordering broke
	openssl's ordering.

2001-10-13  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* Services.pm (filename): More general solution to handle mirror:
	URLs that don't contain a slash.

2001-10-10  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Service.pm (filename): Handle fileanames with the mirror: syntax
	correctly (was broken).

	* PkgVersion.pm (initialize): Parse the new CustomMirror field
	(fetch_source): pass the custom mirror list to fetch_url_to_file

	* NetAccess.pm: converted tabs to spaces
	(fetch_url_to_file): some  clean up, now handles "custom" mirrors,
	code that determines the download cmd moved to a seperate function
	so that it will be easier to enhance this.

2001-10-09  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* FinkVersion.pm.in (pkginfo_version): New function to evaluate
	the stamp files for package descriptions.
	* SelfUpdate.pm (check): Use the new pkginfo_version() instead of
	distribution_version(). Stop dead when CVS updating is
	detected. Minor text and code fixes.

	* Services.pm (version_cmp): Changed the version comparison to
	match that of dpkg exactly.

	* SelfUpdate.pm (check): Suppress inject.pl's user info message.

2001-10-07  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm (get_tarball): Handle the new SourceRename and
	Source#Rename fields.
	(fetch_source): Use get_tarball and fetch_url_to_file to handle
	on-the-fly renaming. Disabled verbose error messages, failures are
	handled by fetch_url_to_file. Added tries parameter (passed on to
	fetch_url_to_file).
	(phase_unpack): Offer re-downloading when unpacking fails. Let tar
	handle gzip-compressed files to catch more errors (the shell pipe
	apparently only returns the last command's error code).

2001-10-05  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* NetAccess.pm: Major overhaul. New function fetch_url_to_file
	allows a target file name to be specified. fetch_url calls through
	to the new function. mirror: URL's are handled
	transparently. After obvious failures fetch_url_to_file offers the
	user to retry the same server or a randomly chosen mirror.
	* Services.pm (expand_url): Removed mirror expansion code.
	* PkgVersion.pm (fetch_source): Don't use expand_url, this is now
	handled transparently by fetch_url.

2001-10-04  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* Engine.pm (cmd_scanpackages): Make sure the directory we're
	scanning does exist.

2001-09-27  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm (phase_patch): New fields UpdateConfigGuessInDirs
	and UpdateLibtoolInDirs to copy the replacement files directly
	into a list of subdirectories.

2001-09-21  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm (phase_install): Create a small README for bundle
	packages - dpkg doesn't like empty packages.

2001-09-17  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm: More protection against unexpected white space.

	* Services.pm (collapse_space): New function to collapse all white
	space in a string into a single space. Useful to eliminate
	newlines in fields that shouldn't have any.

2001-09-13  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm (get_binary_depends): Convert newlines to spaces.

2001-09-12  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* PkgVersion.pm (resolve_depends): Include build-time dependencies
	when requested (new field BuildDepends).
	* Engine.pm (real_install): Check build-time dependencies if the
	package is going to be built.

2001-09-12  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* Engine.pm: Added 'apropos' command analog to the Unix 'apropos'
	
2001-09-11  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* SelfUpdate.pm (check): Adapted to the new structure, check
	against the distribution version.

	* FinkVersion.pm.in: Added functions to retreive package manager
	and distribution versions.

	* Services.pm: Resolved circular dependency between Services and
	Config.

2001-09-09  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* Status.pm (read): Make non-existence of the dpkg status file
	non-fatal.

	* Package.pm (get_matching_versions): Implemented the version
	comparisons supported by dpkg.
	* PkgVersion.pm (initialize): Removed special handling for the
	Depends field.
	(get_depends): Removed, not needed any more.
	(resolve_depends): Rewritten to allow versioned dependencies and
	alternatives.
	(get_binary_depends): New function to generate dependencies for
	the .deb.
	(phase_build): Use get_binary_depends for the Depends field. Added
	Recommends, Suggests, Enhances and Pre-Depends.

2001-09-07  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* Bootstrap.pm: Create dpkg status area earlier.

2001-09-06  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* Status.pm (list): Added list() method to retreive the whole
	list, independent of installation status.
	* Package.pm (scan_all): Get list of known packages from dpkg and
	merge it into the info read from files.
	(inject_description): New function to centralize creation of
	version objects.
	* PkgVersion.pm: Added checks for dummy packages created from the
	dpkg status file.

2001-09-04  Christoph Pfisterer  <cp@chrisp.de>

	* Engine.pm (cmd_scanpackages): Fixes to section and priority
	determination.
