FreeJ is an instrument for realtime video manipulation where various input
layers combined with live effects. Layers are implemented to mix together
webcams, TV, movie files, images and text rendered in various ways.
FreeJ can be operated live from a console (S-Lang) and remotely over networks
(SSH), while operations can also be scripted in a object oriented procedural
language (Javascript). The core engine is multithreaded and asynchronous so it
can accept various controllers at the same time: by now MIDI and joystick
controls are implemented. 

FreeJ is being developed in the hope to provide the GNU community with a free
instrument for video manipulation: to be employed in veejaying, theater
performance and digital scenography, while at present is also being used for
visualisation in medical analisys.
