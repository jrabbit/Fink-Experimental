Package: rpm2cpio
Version: 1.1
Revision: 1
Maintainer: Daniel Macks <dmacks@netspace.org>
Description: Extractor for RedHat packages
DescDetail: <<
Dumps the contents of a .rpm file to stdout (as a cpio archive).

This is a pure-perl implementation that does not require building the
whole rpm package manager suite for back-end support.
<<
DescUsage: <<
use: rpm2cpio [file.rpm] > file.cpio

Here's how to use cpio:
     list of contents:   cpio -t -i < /file/name
        extract files:   cpio -d -i < /file/name
<<
DescPort: <<
Original script may have been called "rpm2cpio.pl".

No versioning info known, but there is a note of one minor change so
we'll assume this is "1.1".
<<
DescPackaging: <<
If we ever get an actual "rpm" package again, that will have its own
proper rpm2cpio program. We'll deal with Conflicts/Replaces, renaming
to rpm2cpio.pl, or, update-alternatives if/when that time comes.
