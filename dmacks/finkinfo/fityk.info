Description: Nonlinear curve fitting and data analysis
DescDetail: <<
Fityk is a general-purpose nonlinear curve fitting and data analysis
software.

Although it is being developed to analyze powder diffraction patterns,
it can be used to fit analytical functions to any kind of data:
crystallographic module is an independent part of the program.

At present fityk knows only about common peak-shaped functions
(Gaussian, Lorentzian, Voigt, Pearson VII etc.) and polynomial.
User-defined functions are planned for winter 2004/2005.

In terms of powder diffraction fityk will fit the data with a set of
position-correlated peaks to give the refined lattice parameters,
zero-shift, sample displacement and wavelength.

Fityk offers everything a decent refinement program should offer but
first of all intuitive graphical interface. Apart from the standard
Marquardt least-square algorithm one may choose a genetic algorithm or
Nelder-Mead simplex method for complex or unstable cases.
