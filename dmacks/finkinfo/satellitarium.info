Package: satellitarium
Version: 0.0.beta1
Revision: 1
Description: Graphical display of satellite sky locations
DescDetail: <<
Satellitarium computes high precision positions by using the standard
SGP4/SDP4 satellite motion models. Orbital elements for satellites are
loaded directly from standard TLE (two-line elements) files. Beside
position display, Satellitarium is capable of doing different searches
on satellite conditions. It can, for example, search for visible
passes over observer location or for eclipsing periods of satellites.
<<
DescPort: <<<
The ./configure check forjpeglib.h seems to ignore CPPFLAGS, so use
--with-extra-includes configure option.

Patch ./configure to allow mt-qt (which is how Fink's qt3 is).

On OS X, "timezone" is a compatibility function in libc instead of the
needed int offset variable. But OS X has a tm_gmtoff element in its
struct tm that does what we need. Patched datetime.cpp accordingly.
