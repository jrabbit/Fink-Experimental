Description: Visual diff and merge tool
DescDetail: <<
Meld is a GNOME 2 visual diff and merge tool. It integrates especially
well with CVS. The diff viewer lets you edit files in place (diffs
update dynamically), and a middle column shows detailed changes and
allows merges. The margins show location of changes for easy
navigation, and it also features a tabbed interface that allows you to
open many diffs at once.
