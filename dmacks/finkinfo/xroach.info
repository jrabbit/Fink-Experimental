Package: xroach
Version: 4.4
Revision: 11
Description: Infests your X11 desktop with cockroaches
DescDetail: <<
Xroach displays disgusting cockroaches on your root window. These creepy
crawlies scamper around until they find a window to hide under. Whenever
you move or iconify a window, the exposed orthoptera again scamper for
cover.
<<
DescUsage: Read the manpage, or 'xroach -h' to get started
DescPackaging: Tarball (and directory therein) renamed with version numbers
DescPort: <<
Removed #inlcude for malloc.h

Renamed manpage file so Makefile generated by xmkmf could find it (done as
part of CompileScript (not via TarFilesRename) to make it easier to generate
the .patch).

Changed default roachSpeed (and manpage desc for -speed) to something
more reasonable for modern computers.

Supplied Makefile is a NetBSD-macro fragment, so we write our own Imakefile.
