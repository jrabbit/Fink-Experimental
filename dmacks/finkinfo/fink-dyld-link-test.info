Description: Script to verify dynamic symbol resolution
DescDetail: <<
This script takes the name of one or more installed packages and
checks that all undefined symbols in the .dylib are defined in other
.dylib files to which it is dynamically linked. Only .dylib that have
an accompanying .a (completely parallel name) can be tested at this
time. Files that report missing symbols are likely to give symbol
resolution errors when they are loaded at runtime by other binaries
that link against them. The usual solution is to add -l flags for the
libraries that supply the missing symbols.
