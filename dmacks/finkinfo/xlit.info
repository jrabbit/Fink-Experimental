DescDetail: <<
Xlit is a program for transliterating text, that is, for converting
text from one writing system into another. It allows the user to
define a transliteration simply by typing the input strings in one
window and the strings to which they are to be mapped in another. This
makes it suitable for use for dealing with non-standard
transliteration, such as those often necessary between the language
notes made by a missionary, trader, or other amateur and technical
linguistic notation, or between linguistic notation and a practical
writing system.
