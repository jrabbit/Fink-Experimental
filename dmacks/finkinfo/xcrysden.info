Description: Crystal/molecular structure visualization
DescDetail: <<
XCrySDen is a crystalline and molecular structure visualisation
program, which aims at display of isosurfaces and contours, which can
be superimposed on crystalline structures and interactively rotated
and manipulated. It also possesses some tools for analysis of
properties in reciprocal space such as interactive selection of
k-paths in the Brillouin zone for the band-structure plots, and
visualisation of Fermi surfaces (experimental). XCrySDen also provide
a partial graphical user interface for CRYSTAL ab initio program, and
a visualization system for WIEN ab initio program.
