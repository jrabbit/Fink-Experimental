Gpsim is a simulator for Microchip (TM) PIC (TM) micro-controllers.
It supports most devices in Microchip's 12-bit, 14bit, and 16-bit core
families. In addition, gpsim supports dynamically loadable modules
such as LED's, LCD's, resistors, etc. to extend the simulation
enviroment beyond the PIC.

DescPort: <<
Update autoconf tools to know about darwin platform.

Fix gui/Makefile to remove space between -D and the DATADIR=... token.

Don't have O_SYNC, but on linux O_FSYNC=O_SYNC so use that instead.

Name of parallel-port device is platform-dependent and we don't have
that port at all. Patch modules/paraface.h to add a default-fail case.

Don't have atoll() so patch gui/gui_stopwatch.cc to use the analog to
the underlying routine noted for in the atol manpage.

Shared library confusion! There's no version strings. Parts of the
program use dlopen(), but some libraries seem to be linked against
during compiling.
