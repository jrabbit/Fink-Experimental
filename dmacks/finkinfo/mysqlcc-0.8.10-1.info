Expects Qt to be in its own tree (like qt/{lib,include,bin}). Fink has
merged includes into /sw/include/qt and libs into /sw/lib, which
breaks ./configure --with-qt and instead we pass a CPPFLAGS. Unless in
a single hierarchy, the alogrithm used to determine QMAKESPEC is
broken. Fortunately, Fink's qt3 package provides a profile.d script
that sets QTDIR and QMAKESPEC as env variables.

src/main.cpp uses my_getopt.h, which we learn from MySQL API docs
<http://www.kitebird.com/mysql-book/ch06-2ed.pdf>:
  Note: The new option-processing routines appeared in MySQL 4.0.2,
  but it's best to use 4.0.5 or later. Several problems were
  identified and fixed during the initial shaking-out period from
  4.0.2 to 4.0.5.
which explains the note buried in Changelog.txt (for 0.8.8-beta) that
4.0.3 or later is required (why doesn't ./configure check this?).

#Patch xmysqlDB.c to make *lengths of type "unsigned long" (was "ulong"
#which is undefined). This variable is set to the return value of
#mysql_fetch_lengths(), so looked up that function's prototype in
#%p/include/mysql/*.h.
