Description: Script to help with fink dependencies
DescPort: <<
Based on a fink-devel mailing list post by [someone else] a while ago.
Converted to stand-alone script 6/13/2004 by dmacks.
Patched to correctly pass dpkg STDERR to grep 'not found' 6/13/2004 by dmacks.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
No idea what license to use, so will go with GPL for now.
/usr/bin/sed (at least on 10.3.3) does not have -r flag so need fink's sed.
<<
DescUsage: <<
This script takes the name of an installed fink package and lists all
fink packages containing shared libraries against which files in the
given package are linked.
<<
Source: none
Depends: sed

  sed 's|@PREFIX@|%p|g' < %a/%n.patch > %n
  cp %p/share/doc/fink/COPYING .
<<
CompileScript: echo "Nothing to compile"
InstallScript: <<
  install -m755 -p -d %i/bin
