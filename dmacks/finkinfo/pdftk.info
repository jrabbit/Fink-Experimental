If PDF is electronic paper, then pdftk is an electronic
staple-remover, hole-punch, binder, secret-decoder-ring, and
X-Ray-glasses. Pdftk is a simple tool for doing everyday things with
PDF documents. Keep one in the top drawer of your desktop and use it
to:

    * Merge PDF Documents
    * Split PDF Pages into a New Document
    * Decrypt Input as Necessary (Password Required)
    * Encrypt Output as Desired
    * Burst a PDF Document into Single Pages
    * Report on PDF Metrics, including Metadata and Bookmarks
    * Uncompress and Re-Compress Page Streams
    * Repair Corrupted PDF (Where Possible)

Pdftk is also an example of how to use a library of Java classes in a
stand-alone C++ program. Specifically, it demonstrates how GCJ and CNI
allow C++ code to use iText's (itext-paulo) Java classes
