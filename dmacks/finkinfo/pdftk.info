Description: Handy tool for manipulating PDF
DescDetail: <<
       If  PDF  is  electronic paper, then pdftk is an electronic
       staple-remover, hole-punch,  binder,  secret-decoder-ring,
       and  X-Ray-glasses.   Pdftk  is  a  simple  tool for doing
       everyday things with PDF documents.  Use it to:

       * Merge PDF Documents
       * Split PDF Pages into a New Document
       * Decrypt Input as Necessary (Password Required)
       * Encrypt Output as Desired
       * Fill PDF Forms with FDF Data and/or Flatten Forms
       * Apply a Background Watermark
       * Report PDF Metrics such as Metadata and Bookmarks
       * Update PDF Metadata
       * Attach Files to PDF Pages or the PDF Document
       * Unpack PDF Attachments
       * Burst a PDF Document into Single Pages
       * Uncompress and Re-Compress Page Streams
       * Repair Corrupted PDF (Where Possible)

DescPackaging: <<
This package requires gcc42. It does not build with gcc43 or newer.
AFAIK, the problem with pdftk is that it illegally mixes C++ and Java  
exceptions. gcc 4.2 was nice enough to compile it somehow, and at   
least it worked. The newer gcc 4.3 just spits out the error msg and  
stops. The latest version is from 2006.
	gcc bug in default -O2 optimizer? See:
	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=485641#c12
	RedHat scraps -O2 in their gcc44 patch for pdftk.
	gcc-4.4.0 includes the upstream patch to solve it, so fink
	seems safe to just leap over bugged gcc43 to avoid this cause
	of build failure.

	Borrow a gentoo patch to enable building with gcc44's
	relocated Calendar class. See:
	http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=269312#c4
