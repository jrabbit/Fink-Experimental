	CMap files are not GPL (see LICENSE file for info)

#	Hack to build the lib *only*, not programs on top of it.

#	Privatize all symbols except ones that seem part of external
#	API (avoids multiple-definition warnings and other collisions
#	if linking against both libgs and an external lib that libgs
#	also has internally

	ghostscript/%v/doc referenced in .dylib, so put it in -shlibs

	Other support-files used by .dylib placed in -shlibs; probably
	also used by bin/gs and other programs in %n=ghostscript so
	Depends:%N-shlibs even though don't seem to link against the
	.dylib

	Hack to pass global -I last (use separate compiler-command and
	flag vars instead of unified one that concatenates them all in
	the wrong order). This is a mess! Easier to just wrap gcc in a
	script that re-orders them correctly.

	Remember to pass necessary -l and -L flags rather than local
	object files if if using external libs.

#	Use external libs whenever possible and adjust makefiles to
#	pass fink -I and -L flags for them:
#		expat (use included until we know for sure)
#		icclib (use included--just a truncated/subset of full)
#		ijs (no support for external)
#		imdi (use included until we know for sure)
#		jasper (use included--needs customized lib)
#		jbig2dec (use fink's)
#		jpeg (use included--needs customized lib)
#		libpng (use fink's)
#		zlib (use system)
	Hard to get any of this to work correctly with external libs,
	so go with on-board for everything for now.

	Seems to need some cups symbols not present in 10.4's libcups

#	Don't include actual png_push_fill_buffer() workaround for
#	apparent local libpng issue because we're using external lib
#	that already has non-static prototype (and symbol isn't used
#	anywhere in gs anyway)
