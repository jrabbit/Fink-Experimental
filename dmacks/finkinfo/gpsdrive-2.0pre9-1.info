Package: gpsdrive
Version: 2.0pre9
Revision: 1
Description: GPS-based navigation tool
DescDetail: <<
GpsDrive is a car (bike, ship, plane) navigation system. GpsDrive
displays your position provided from your NMEA capable GPS receiver on
a zoomable map, the map file is autoselected depending of the position
and prefered scale. Speech output is supported if the "festival"
software is running. The maps are autoselected for best resolution
depending of your position and can be downloaded from Internet. All
Garmin GPS reveiver with a serial output should be usable, also other
GPS receiver which supports NMEA protocol.

For optional MySQL support, install 'mysql-shlibs'.

Note that this is a beta release, so some things may not be working.

DescUsage: <<
'man gpsdrive' to get started.

You may have to adjust the /dev path for communication with Garmin.

There are reports that mouse buttons do not work correctly. The
following was posted to the gpsdrive mailing list:

  I had this problem and haven't been able to fix it, but I have found that
  with a two-button mouse you can actually duplicate the right and left
  button behaviours in a strange way: you have to click both buttons first
  the mouse clicking the one you want and without relasing clicking the
  second one, thus:
  
  left-click-hold, right click-release: left click
  right-click-hold, left click-release: right click

Apple Developer Tools is GNUish, so I don't know why __GNU_LIBRARY__
isn't defined, but it needs to be so that GNU getopt.h (which this
package needs) doesn't conflict with the unistd.h declaration of
getopt().

Hack around ./configure not supporting --docdir (uncontrollably put
under $datadir as share/gpsdrive).

At run-time, gpsdrive checks if the MySQL client library is available,
and enables MySql support if so (mysql version 3/libversion 10).

gpsd.c does not compile (for me, anyway) under ccache (so the Fink
ccache-default package must not be installed while gpsdrive is being
built).

The version-info patch should be rolled into %f.patch as Makefile.in,
but for now we need to rerun auto* first so would have to put it in
Makefile.am; this isn't something for non-Darwin platforms, so I'd
rather make it obvious to myself that this isn't something to be
incorporated into the program but instead I must remember to keep this
in the Fink patch.
