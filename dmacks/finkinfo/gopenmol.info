With gOpenMol small molecules, and to lesser extent protein
structures, as well as the chemical properties, total electron
densities and molecule orbitals of small molecules can be visualized
and analyzed. Data from a variety of computational chemistry programs
such as TurboMole, Gaussian, Gamess, etc., can be analyzed if the
output files from these programs have been converted into the
.plt-file format understood by gOpenMol. Moreover, dynamics done with,
e.g., InsightII can be visualized and a short mpeg animation of the
dynamics files generated.

DescPort: <<
The %p/bin/tclsh from tcltk-8.4.1-2 emits DOS-style line-endings
(\r\n) which breaks parsing of its output by configure. Patch
configure to fix the line-endings.

Darwin has no malloc.h, so discard all #include of it. But malloc()
needs sys/types.h for size_t. The recommended replacement for malloc.h
is stdlib.h, which brings along size_t for us.

Darwin (gcc) cpp can't handle null parameters to macros, so fix the
last param IMPLEMENT_GET_MODIFIABLE_POINTER in trajectory.c to
something harmless.
