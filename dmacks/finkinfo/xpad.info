Remove -ansi since it breaks glib.h.

Remove -pedantic to silence a boatload of
  warning: style of line directive is a GCC extension
in files from /usr/include and
  warning: ISO C forbids braced-groups within expressions
in src/*.c

Fix some printf formats.

configure doesn't check for a defined socklen_t type.

Need to directly link to X11, otherwise
  ld: eggtrayicon.o illegal reference to symbol: _XFlush defined in indirectly referenced dynamic library /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.6.dylib
during final linking. Cannot pass it as LDFLAGS since configure tests
to make sure the compiler works before it determines the location of
the X11 libs so -lX11 causes that test to fail.

I don't see the need to drag a desktop manager into this package at
this point, so we will not be installing the associated support files.
Maybe they should go into a SplitOff?
