Package: xscreensaver
Version: 4.08
Revision: 1
Description: Screen saver and locker for X11
DescDetail: <<
From the manpage:

       The  xscreensaver  program  waits  until  the keyboard and
       mouse have been idle for a period, and then runs a  graph-
       ics  demo chosen at random.  It turns off as soon as there
       is any mouse or keyboard activity.

DescPort: <<
To (try to) keep everything Fink under %p, we Depends: app-defaults
(overrides /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/ -> /etc/X11/app-defaults/
with %p/etc/app-defaults). We patch configure since autoconf doesn't
know to check app-defaults paths, and the configure script (natively)
checks a different env variable.

Doesn't look like libgle has been ported to OS X, so we omit it.

Locking is disabled (since x11 is just another userland app on OS X).

Some modules require binaries things that we aren't installed by
this Fink package, but will work if you install them yourself:
