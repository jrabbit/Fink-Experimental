Description: Tool that shows network usage, similar to top
License: GPL
Homepage: http://www.ntop.org/
DescDetail: <<
ntop shows the current network usage. It displays a list of hosts that
are currently using the network and reports information concerning the
(IP and non-IP) traffic generated by each host.  ntop may operate as a
front-end collector (sFlow and/or netFlow plugins) or as a stand-alone
collector/display program. A web browser is needed to access the
infor- mation captured by the ntop program.

ntop is a hybrid layer 2 / layer 3 network monitor, that is by default
it uses the layer 2 Media Access Control (MAC) addresses AND the layer
3 tcp/ip addresses.  ntop is capable of associating the two, so that
ip and non-ip traffic (e.g. arp, rarp) are combined for a complete
picture of network activity.
<<
DescUsage: <<
You must run this as root ('sudo ntop').

Read the documentation to learn how to access the server.
<<
DescPort: <<
The xmldump plugin needs gdome which is not in fink right now.
  
Remove hardcoded addition of /usr/local to *FLAGS in configure.

Remove local getopt* since we already have libgetopt.

TODO:
  Remove phone-home "feature"

  Fix xmlversion.h check

  Get libgdome into fink

  Fix "enter password" function
