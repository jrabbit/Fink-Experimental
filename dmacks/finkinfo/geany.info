  __unix__ is not defined so certain code blocks are disabled...dunno
  what they're supposed to do so leaving it along for now. See:
  https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1387839&group_id=153444&atid=787791

  Builds fine, many runtime problems:
    dumps core when quitting (after confirming "yes")
      https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1387862&group_id=153444&atid=787791
    hangs when saving (sometimes)
    hangs when compiling

  Need to patch path to libvte.4.dylib into src/vte.c vte_init() and
  add dependency for it.

DescDetail: <<
Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment.
It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a few
dependencies from other packages. Another goal was to be as
independent as possible from a special Desktop Environment like KDE or
GNOME. So it is using only the GTK2 toolkit and therefore you need
only the GTK2 runtime libraries to run Geany.

The basic features of Geany are:
- syntax highlighting
- code completion
- auto completion of often used constructs like if, for and while
- auto completion of XML and HTML tags
- call tips
- many supported filetypes like C, Java, PHP, HTML, Python, Perl, Pascal
- symbol lists
<<
DescUsage: <<
To run Geany just type

  $ geany

on a console or use the applications menu from your desktop
environment. There a few command line options. See the manual page of
Geany or run

  $ geany --help

for details. Or look into the documention in the %p/share/doc/%n
directory. The most important option probably is -c or --config,
wherewith you can specify an alternate configuration directory.
