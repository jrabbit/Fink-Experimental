Version: 1.9
Revision: 1
Description: X11 interface to MySQL databases
DescPackaging: <<
Homepage (as noted in the tarball) is 404, so I don't know a Source.

No manpage.
<<
DescPort: <<
Set a bunch of paths (as explained in the Makefile).

Patch xmysqlDB.c to make *lengths of type "unsigned long" (was "ulong"
which is undefined). This variable is set to the return value of
mysql_fetch_lengths(), so looked up that function's prototype in
%p/include/mysql/*.h.
