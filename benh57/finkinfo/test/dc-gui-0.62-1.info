Description: GNOME Direct Connect (file sharing) GUI
DescDetail: <<
dc_gui is a GNOME GUI for DCTC, a Direct Connect filesharing client.

Current (beta) features:
*  dc_gui can start new clients and/or attach itself to
already running DCTC. You can also start several connection at the same time. 
You can switch between several DCTC.
*  Search: mono-hub search works and takes into account all search
criterias. It is already possible to start a download by clicking on the
wanted file.
*  User list: the user list is simply displayed. It is already possible
to retrieve user shared files list.
*  Transfers: transfers are displayed and can be killed (either using
the popup menu or using the 'd' key).
*  Preferences: current DCTC preferences are displayed and taken into
account to start new client or to update running client.

This package is available for an interested maintainer to take over.
Known issues: some problems with display of shared filesizes.
<<
DescUsage: <<
  Enter settings and profile information in the "User Prefs" tab. Then click 
  "start dummy client" in the connect tab. I suggest reading the Help as 
  direct connect has many more options than most filesharing clients.
  
  Note: The client keeps running after you quit the GUI!
