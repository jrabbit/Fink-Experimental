Description: Fractal explorer
DescDetail: << 
XaoS is a fast portable real-time interactive fractal zoomer. It displays the Mandelbrot set 
(among other escape time fractals) and allows you zoom smoothly into the fractal. It uses lots 
of optimization techniques to save about 97% of calculations necessary to calculate next frame 
to make zooming as fast as possible.

To make result more interesting, various coloring modes, formulas, planes and palette are supported.
 XaoS is also able to record and replay animations using simple script language. We've prepared 
about half an hour long movie "Introduction to fractals" with over 500 images and animations.

For those who are lazy to explore fractals manually an autopilot function is provided.
