Description: Direct Connect Text Client
DescDetail: <<
Direct Connect Text Client is the backend for the "dc_gui" (GNOME) 
and "ldcc" (console) direct connect file sharing clients.
Features:
*  Query/Reply: passive dans active mode, single or multi hub searches.
*  Upload/Download: both in passive and active mode.
*  Public/Private chat.
*  Users: Display both user information and user list of hub.
*  Segmented Download (GDL): download the same file from multiple sources.
*  autoscan: DCTC can periodically search for new download sources.
*  Multi hub search and download: a search or a download can be
performed on hub not connected to the current DCTC. The command is
relayed by other DCTCs (DCTC link).
*  Direct Download (DDL): Start transfers without hub help. Thus, you can 
download from someone who is not on one of the hubs you are.
*  SOCKS support (v4 and v5).
*  Upload and download bandwidth limitation.

This package is available for an interested maintainer to take over.
