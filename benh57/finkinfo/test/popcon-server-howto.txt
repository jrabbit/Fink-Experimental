Fink popcon SERVER howto:


0. Must have fink Packages files and popularity-contest pkg installed on server machine. The server scripts parse the Fink "Packages" files. One problem that still exists is that the script can't handle the gzipped Packages files that fink makes, they must be un-gzipped first.

Actually you don't need fink itself on the target machine, just access to the Packages files. You could change the path to the Packages files in the python script, or muss with the python to grab them from the web perhaps..

1. Extract popcon.tar.gz to /Library/Webserver/Documents/popcon (or wherever, an accessible dir)
2. Edit /sw/share/popularity-contest/scripts/popcon-process.sh and specify POPDIR as that directory.
3. Set up mail alias, or some other method (rsync, whatever) to redirect and append email from submission address to /Library/WebServer/Documents/new-popcon-entries

sample .procmailrc for this, in my home directory:

# Procmailrc for redirecting mail
PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin:/sw/bin:/sw/sbin.
MAILDIR=$HOME/Library/unixmail      # You'd better make sure it exists
DEFAULT=$MAILDIR/mbox
LOGFILE=$MAILDIR/from
LOCKFILE=$HOME/.lockmail

:0                    # Anything subject with popularity
* ^Subject.*popularity
/Library/WebServer/Documents/popcon/new-popcon-entries

4. Run /sw/share/popularity-contest/scripts/popcon-process.sh in (weekly?) crontab
