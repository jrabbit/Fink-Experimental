Description: Cross-platform (unix,windows,mac) GUI API - unix version.
DescDetail: <<
 In addition to common and advanced GUI facilities such as
 frames, scrolling windows, toolbars, tree controls, icons,
 device contexts, printing, splitter windows and so on, there are
 wrappers for common file operations, and facilities for writing
 TCP/IP applications, thread handling, and more. Where certain
 features are not available on a platform, such as MDI and tree
 controls on Unix, they are emulated.
<<
DescPort: <<
 the ConfigureParam (--with-gtk) prevents it from detecting MacOS X.
 patch to configure to permit proper detection of
 freetype headers, and linking of libiconv.
 added -install_name to linker flags so 
 DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH does not need to be set manually.
