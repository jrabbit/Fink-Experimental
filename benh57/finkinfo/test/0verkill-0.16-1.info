Description: 2D deathmatch game in ASCII art.
DescDetail: <<
0verkill is a client-server 2D deathmatch-like game in ASCII art. It supports free connecting/disconnecting during the game, and runs well on modem lines. Graphics 
are in 16-color ASCII art with elaborate hero animations. 0verkill features 4 
different weapons, grenades, invisibility, and armor. The package also contains 
reaperbot clients, a simple graphics editor, and a level editor.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Run the server (called "0verkill-server") then launch the client as "x0verkill" for the
X-Windows version. Enter "127.0.0.1" for the server name.
<<
DescPackaging: << 
The only issue here is the generic names of some of it's apps. ("server" "editor")
Some of them conflict, so i renamed the symlinks to 0verkill-editor,xeditor,server),etc.
