Description: MiKTeX package manager tools 
DescDetail: << 
  The MiKTeX Tools package does not comprise a TeX system.
  The package should be regarded as an addition to the TeX system
  installed on your system.

  The following utilities are included:
  - initexmf: MiKTeX Configuration Utility
  - mpm: MiKTeX Package Manager
  - mthelp: MiKTeX Help Utility (experimental)

DescUsage: <<
 By default, mpm installs its packages into %p/share/texmf-local.
 You can change this by using the option --install-root with mpm.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 The dylibs are purely local, so no shlibs splitoff is needed.
