Description: Next-generation GNOME file manager.
DescDetail: <<
Nautilus is an open-source file manager and graphical shell being developed by 
Eazel, Inc. and others. It is part of the GNOME project, and its source code can 
be found in the GNOME CVS repository. Nautilus is still in the early stages of 
development. It will become an integral part of the GNOME desktop environment 
when it is finished.
<<
DescPort: <<
- Libtool conveniece library bug fixed.
- Conflicting versions of libxml headers replaced.
- Mozilla pointed out to configure script.
- 'test' directory not built.
- gdk-pixbuf includes, libintl libraries added where needed.
- Unknown use of 'Wl,' flag to cc removed.
- get_mount_list() changed to use getmntinfo instead of /proc/mounts.
- added makefile rule for .oaf.in file, to set the full location of
  a component.
- added file system attributes for HFS.
<<
DescUsage: <<
If you are running X rootless, launch Nautilus with '--no-desktop' flag, so it
doesn't take over root window. If you are running an early version of oafd,
try "oaf-slay" before running Nautilus.

Known bugs:
- Web searches crash the mozilla view.
- Opening the "Backgrounds and Emblems" dialog segfaults.
- Not really a bug, but Nautilus knows nothing about resource forks, Mac
    applications, bundles, etc. So beware! Certain actions (like moving a file
    with a rsource fork to another disk) may damage your data.
<<
ChangeLog: <<

1.0.6-2 :
	- Tree view works.
	- "Failure to allocate ~2 GB" startup error gone with new version of orbit.
	- Help pages display properly.
	- scrollkeeper-update performed in Post{Inst|Rm}Scripts.
	- sample component no longer built, to save time.
