Description: Next-generation GNOME 2 file manager.
DescDetail: <<
Nautilus is an open-source file manager and graphical shell being developed by 
Eazel, Inc. and others. It is part of the GNOME project, and its source code can 
be found in the GNOME CVS repository. Nautilus is still in the early stages of 
development. It will become an integral part of the GNOME desktop environment 
when it is finished.
<<
DescUsage: <<
If you are running X rootless, launch Nautilus with '--no-desktop' flag, so it
doesn't take over root window. If you are running an early version of oafd,
try "oaf-slay" before running Nautilus.

Known bugs:
- Not really a bug, but Nautilus knows nothing about resource forks, Mac
    applications, bundles, etc. So beware! Certain actions (like moving a file
    with a rsource fork to another disk) may damage your data.
