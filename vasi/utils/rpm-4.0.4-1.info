Description: RPM Package Manager
DescDetail: <<
RPM is the RPM Package Manager. It is an open packaging system available for anyone to use.
It allows users to take source code for new software and package it into source and binary
form such that binaries can be easily installed and tracked and source can be rebuilt
easily. It also maintains a database of all packages and their files that can be used for
verifying packages and querying for information about files and/or packages.

This version of RPM is not set up to do installs, you will need to edit your rpmmacros
file to add this capability. Set %_topdir to %{_usrsrc}/apple for this.
