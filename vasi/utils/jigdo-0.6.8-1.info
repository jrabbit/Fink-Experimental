Jigsaw Download, or short jigdo, is a scheme developed primarily to make it easy to distribute huge filesystem images (e.g. CD (ISO9660) or DVD (UDF) images) over the internet, but it could also be used for other data which is awkward to handle due to its size, like audio/video files or large software packages.

jigdo tries to ensure that the large image is downloaded in small parts which can be stored on different servers. People who want to download the image do so by telling the software to process one .jigdo file; using that file, jigdo downloads the parts and reassembles the original file.

Jigdo is currently the recommended way to download Debian ISO images. See http://www.debian.org/CD/jigdo-cd for more info.
