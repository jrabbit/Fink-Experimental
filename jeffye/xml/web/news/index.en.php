Thanks to Baba Yoshihiko, Fink has now taken the necessary steps to allow for 
internationalisation efforts. 
The improved infrastructure enables us to display a multilingual web-site to our visitors from all over the world. 
</p>
<p>
This also means that we need volunteers. The Fink web-site needs to be translated into the language of your choice. 
A translation into Japanese is being worked on and the translation into French has been taken over by Mich√®le Garoche. 
Which language are you willing to translate?
</p>
<p>
If you are willing to become a member of the internationalisation team or wish to provide feedback on 
the web-site feel free to join the new mailing-list.
You can do so by going to our <a href="<?php print $root; ?>lists/index.php">mailing-lists page</a>. The full announcement on the existing 
mailing lists can be read <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.os.apple.fink.devel/7554">here</a>.

	<p>
If you previously had Java 1.4.1 and the Java SDK installed, the new
Java 1.4.2 update from apple will upgrade the Java runtime to 1.4.2,
but will <b>remove</b> the previous 1.4.1 Java runtime and
SDK <b>without</b> upgrading the JDK.  To build Java packages in Fink
you will need to <a href="http://connect.apple.com/">go to
connect.apple.com and download the Java 1.4.2 SDK</a> (free
registration required).

	<p>
Many of the binary files for 10.3 have been updated, eliminating problems
with qt and kde, among others.  To access the updated files, bring your
index of binary files up-to-date by running the
command <code>sudo apt-get update</code> .  After this, you can use
apt-get, dselect or FinkCommander to install binary files as usual.

	<p>
	Thanks to the new Fink GNOME Core team, including a lot of hard work by packaging
	newcomer Keith Conger and GNOME 1.x maintainer Masanori Sekino, GNOME 2.4 has
	finally been released to the 10.3 unstable tree.
	</p>
	<p>
	It is there for the taking; please offer some of your time and test these packages
	if you are on unstable already.  Because of the massive number of changes, it is
	expected that there will be issues upgrading or installing the new GNOME.  If you
	have problems, you can reach the GNOME-savvy people at
	<a href="mailto:fink-gnome-core@lists.sourceforge.net">fink-gnome-core@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.
	Please do report success stories there as well.  The more good reports we get, the
	faster GNOME 2.4 can be moved to stable.
	</p>

	A happy new year to all of you from the whole team. Blame this outburst of an 
	attempt at slang language on some of us having to watch the MTV Music Awards all
   day long.
	</p>
	<p>
	Last year has been a good year for Fink. We have had hard times keeping up with 
	the changes introduces by Apple, but we also learned that we have a great community
	which is willing to go through great lengths to support us. 
	For this, we say "Thank You". Much of what happens in the Fink project
   happens because of the amazing support and encouragement we get from our users.
	</p>
	<p>
	Two Zero Zero Four should not make us slow down, but speed up. There are some 
	interesting things in the pipeline, including GNOME 2.4, a new release of KDE, major 
	changes to the package manager itself, and organisational restructuring. 
	Hopefully we will advance into an even bigger project with developer conferences, 
	real life meetings, and a CD in your favourite shop.
	</p>
	<p>
	High ambitions can make one fall very deeply, thus we shall take it carefully, but 
	still we are all counting on your support during this year. Tell us what you think 
	about Fink; tell us what you like or dislike; show us ways to improve ourselves.
	Lend us your resources and sponsor a mirror or hardware. Devote some of your time
	to improve the package manager or add another piece of software by creating an
	info file. Browse this website and hopefully indulge yourself. We enjoy serving
	such a nice community; hopefully we shall make it a smooth ride for you and
	your Macintosh in Two Zero Zero Four.

 world of UNIX together with Mac OS X.
 		</p>
		<p>
 We wish you all, that your hope is not too frail and that you will carry on following 
 through with your wishes. May the world we live in gradually become a better place and
 may peace and understanding settle just for a few days.

 Enjoy your quiet time and in case we do not get around to saying it soon enough. 
 A happy new year to all of you, stay with us we count on your support.

	Thank you, thank you, thank you. What a great community we have.
	Thank you for providing us with more mirrors.

		<p>
	Matthew Healey, member of the Western <a href="http://www.wamug.org.au">
	Australian</a> Macintosh User Group, and their 
	ISP <a href="http://www.extremedsl.com.au">extremedsl</a>
	are providing Fink with a full mirror in Perth, Australia. This is our first
	mirror in down under, thus I am pleased to welcome them to the family.
	Furthermore the <a href="http://www.mirror.ac.uk">UKMIRROR</a> service 
	has accepted us, making distfile services available for Fink 
	on 21 load balanced server.
		</p>
		<p>
	We are very happy about this development, but we still need more rsync mirrors.
	Thus, once more, if you feel like helping, please visit 
	<a href="http://finkmirrors.net">finkmirrors.net</a> and get in touch.

	<p>While we welcome our latest full mirror in Norway, sponsored by Havar Valeur, 
        we crave more. To improve our service to all of you, we would like to ask that
        you evaluate carefully if you maybe do have the resources to become a mirror. 
        </p>    
        <p>     
        All it takes is a 10Mbit link, around 100MB of disk space  and some bandwidth you are 
        willing to share for Fink. The exact setup instructions for rsync mirrors can be found 
        <a href="http://finkmirrors.net/rsync.html">here</a>. Especially mirrors in
        Asia, Australia, New Zealand, South Europe and Middle Europe are welcome, since we have none in 
        those regions yet. If you feel generous and wish to donate even more resources, please visit
        <a href="http://finkmirrors.net">finkmirrors.net</a> to learn about your options.
        </p>    
        <p>     
        The current status of all available rsync mirrors can be viewed on the finkmirrors.net pages as well.
        We hope to improve this service in the future, yet this depends on your willingness to help us out. 
        We are looking forward to many new applications and thank our community in advance.

	<a name="2003-11-17 Fink 0.6.2 released"><span class="news-date">2003-11-17: </span><span class="news-headline">Fink 0.6.2 released</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
        <p>The latest Fink release, version 0.6.2, is now available
for both source and binary users.  This is a bug-fix release, intended
to address two problems: the dselect/user deletion bug, and a 
problem with ownership of files.  The dselect bug was addressed by
updating the fink, dpkg, and apt packages.  After updating to 0.6.2,
it is safe to once again use dselect.  However, if you ran dselect
at any time since 0.6.0, you should carefully check the integrity
of the file at <code>/sw/etc/apt/sources.list</code>.  If you have
any doubts about this file, you should replace it with
<a href="<?php print $root; ?>files/sources.list">the default sources.list file</a>.
</p>
<p>Users who have installed binary files from the 0.6.1 distribution
may find that certain files in their Fink installation are owned
by UID 2011 rather than by root.  To correct this problem,
run the command:</p>
<pre>sudo find /sw/ -user 2011 -exec chown root:admin {} \;</pre>
<p>This release, like the previous one, was built on OS X 10.2
using the gcc 3.3 compiler, and runs fine with some exceptions* on OS X 10.3.  Most Fink 
users who upgrade to 10.3 will continue to
want to only use the binaries from this
new distribution for now, while the Fink team continues to modify
Fink packages for 10.3.
</p>
<p>*Exceptions include: emacs, qt.
</p>
	<a name="2003-11-04 User Deletion Bug/ Dselect Troubles"><span class="news-date">2003-11-04: </span><span class="news-headline">User Deletion Bug/ Dselect Troubles</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
<p><b>Quick Summary: DO NOT USE DSELECT,</b> and if you've used it,
check your /sw/etc/apt/sources.list file carefully.</p>
		<p>Users who have bootstrapped or installed Fink 0.5.3 or Fink 0.6.0
		on Mac OS X 10.3 could exhibit a problem where all users get deleted
		from the netinfo database, and you become unable to log in.
We believe that this problem can only occur if you've used dselect.</p>
		<p>If you are using Mac OS X 10.3, please be sure you're using the
		latest Fink version to avoid the issue.  To make sure you don't have
		upgrade problems, check your <code>/sw/etc/apt/sources.list</code>
		file.  You will need to modify it if it contains <code>deb</code>
		lines that point to "release" or "current" without a version number.
		In other words, if your <code>sources.list</code> file contains
		these lines:</p>
		<pre>deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download release main
deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download current main</pre>
		<p>...you should change them to this:</p>
		<pre>deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download 10.3/release main
deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download 10.3/current main</pre>
		<p>We are working on updating the repository to make sure that even
		if you update you don't get the broken code, and to
repair dselect, but in the meantime,
		make sure your <code>sources.list</code> file has the correct entries.</p>
<p>Other users have experienced problems with dselect itself, particularly
complaints about a missing "darwin" package.  If you are running dselect
under 10.3 and you <b>don't</b> get this warning, then your 
<code>sources.list</code> file is likely to be corrupted and you should
repair it as above.

	<a name="2003-11-01 Fink 0.6.1 released"><span class="news-date">2003-11-01: </span><span class="news-headline">Fink 0.6.1 released</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
        <p>The latest Fink release, version 0.6.1, is now available
for both source and binary users.  This release was built on OS X 10.2
using the gcc 3.3 compiler, and runs well on OS X 10.3.  Most Fink
users who upgrade to 10.3 will want to only use the binaries from this
new distribution for now, while the Fink team continues to modify
Fink packages for 10.3.
</p><p>
If you wish to access the 
new binaries, use apt-get, dselect, or the binary mode of
FinkCommander.  Unless you are interested in helping the Fink team
to test packages which are compiled on 10.3, 
do not use the command-line <code>fink</code> program to do your
installations for the
next few weeks.
</p>
<p>The simplest way to upgrade a binary installation is to run
"sudo apt-get update".  Further details and
other issues related to upgrading Fink to 10.3 are addressed on the
<a href="<?php print $root; ?>download/10.3-upgrade.php">Special 10.3 upgrade page.</a>
</p><p>
Before using the latest version of
the command-line <code>fink</code> program 
under OS X 10.2, be sure to install the August2003gccUpdater, available
after free registration from connect.apple.com.

		<p>
		We wish all of you a happy Halloween.

		<p>
		Furthermore I would like to welcome our new mirrors to the Fink family.
		From Europe in Rijeka, Croatia a new full mirror joins us. This mirrors 
		has been sponsored by the <a href="http://mac.dir.hr/">Jabucnjak</a> Apple user group. 
		This is our first mirror in Europe, so I hope that more will be joining us 
		soon.
		</p>
		<p>
		Dave Schroeder from the <a href="http://mirror.services.wisc.edu/">University of 
		Wisconsin</a> in Madison is sponsoring a 100Mbit dedicated Master server.
		A. J. Wright and <a href="http://sunsite.utk.edu/">SunSITE@UTK</a> are helping out with 
		another full mirror in the United states. 
		</p>
		<p>
		This raises our full mirror count to four and the rsync mirror count to 
		five. We are happy to have such a great community back us up, but I know 
		that more mirrors will join over time. I will not stop nagging you until
		Fink has its own mirror in every state of the USA. Yet, with such a 
		brilliant community backing us up, I am not too worried about not
		reaching my goal very soon.
		</p>
		<p>
		Trick or treat! Our most wanted treat is more mirrors, so come forth 
		Administrators and fill our bag. Information on how you can be a mirror
		can be found on the official <a href="http://finkmirrors.net">
		mirroring website</a>.

	<p>As you surely noticed, Fink has a logo. This is the result of our
	Logo <a href="<?php print $root; ?>logo.php">contest</a> held earlier this year.
	This new, official, logo has been displayed since the 24th of October and
	those of you who wondered how it has been picked and what the name of the
	winner is should read up in the PR <a href="<?php print $root; ?>pr/index.php">section</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	The longer explanation also features a larger version of the logo itself,
	so that you may have a closer look at its details. We like our new logo,
	we hope that you will like it too.
	</p>
	<p>IMPORTANT: We do not yet have a formal licensing agreement for the new
   logo and so are unable to give permission to distribute it.  Currently, it
   can only be displayed on the Fink web page.  Thank you for your understanding.
	</p>
		<a name="2003-10-24 Upgrade to gcc 3.3 and/or 10.3"><span class="news-date">2003-10-24: </span><span class="news-headline">Upgrade to gcc 3.3 and/or 10.3</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
	<p>It is now possible to upgrade Fink to take full advantage of the gcc 3.3
compiler, or to use OS X 10.3 if you have that installed.  Binary packages
corresponding to these upgrades are not yet available, so if you make 
extensive use of binary packages you may wish to wait a few days before 
upgrading.
</p><p>
If you wish to perform this upgrade, and you had previously installed the
June 2003 Developer Tools update from Apple, you will need to install
the August 2003 Developer Tools update BEFORE you upgrade Fink.  Under
10.3, be sure to install XCode from the XCode disk before upgrading
Fink.
</p><p>
Running "fink selfupdate" should perform the upgrade for you.  The latest
version of the fink package manager will automatically detect which
version of OS X and which version of gcc you have installed, and will
adjust itself accordingly.
</p><p>
If you wish to do a fresh install of Fink on a 10.3 system, we recommend
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/srcdist.php">bootstrapping from
source,</a> starting from fink-full-0.6.0.tar.gz available
on fink's <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203">sourceforge 
download page.</a>  You'll need XCode for this as
well.
</p><p>
Also note that once you have Fink version 0.15.0 or higher, you do
not need to install system-xfree86 anymore.  Fink is
capable of automatically determining your system-xfree86 version if you
don't already have any fink x11 packages installed.  If you currently
have an old system-xfree86 package of any kind installed, please run the
following:
</p>
<pre>sudo dpkg -r --force-all system-xfree86 system-xfree86-42 \
system-xfree86-43; fink selfupdate; fink index</pre>
<p>
The Fink team is still working on getting Fink packages working under 10.3,
but many many packages already work.

</p>
<p>In addition, this version of the fink package manager is compatible

fink will ask you to reset your gcc version whenever
that is necessary.</p>

<p>As announced in <a href="http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2003-21.html">this CERT 
advisory</a>, it has recently been discovered that
the ftp servers for GNU software were compromised back in March, 
although it is not believed that any of the source code housed there
was affected.
</p><p>
Fink relies on MD5 checksums when downloading software, and we have had
no reports of incorrect checksums in Fink packages.  The Free Software
Foundation is in the process of verifying the integrity of all of the
source code distributed from that ftp site.  As of this writing, the source
code for the following Fink packages have not yet been verified:
<code>autoconf2.54</code>,
<code>emacs21</code>,
<code>gprolog</code>,
<code>groff</code>,
<code>guile16</code>,
<code>help2man</code>,
<code>jwhois</code>,
<code>libtool14</code>,
<code>libosip1</code>,
<code>sed</code>,
<code>slib</code>.
It may be difficult to install those packages at present.

<p><b>Quick Summary: DO NOT INSTALL THIS UPDATE.</b></p>
               <p>
Apple has released a patch to the December 2002 
Developer Tools which includes gcc 3.3,
their new compiler.
</p><p>
Fink does not yet support compiling with gcc 3.3.  In addition, it is important
not to "mix and match" between compilers:  all C++ code in fink packages
needs to be compiled
with the same compiler.
</p><p>
For this reason, the Fink team recommends that if you update your
Developer Tools with the new patch, you should be careful to run
<code>sudo gcc_select 3</code>
prior to any "fink build" or "fink install" commands.
</p>
<p><b>Update 30 June 2003:</b> A 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=2680195&amp;forum_id=2056">problem
has now been detected</a> with
the new assembler program which the update installs, which may prevent
certain Fink packages from being compiled at all if you install this
update.  
</p>
<p><b>Generally, Fortran programs will break if you install the update;
the breakage does not stop by simply switching back to gcc 3.1.</b>
The Fink team is working on a workaround for this problem, but until it
is ready, if you need Fortran-related programs you should not install
the update.</p>

               <p>Fink and 
<a href="http://www.macwelt.de/">MacWelt</a> have managed to organize a logo contest.
For the next six weeks everyone is invited to submit their logo creations. 
Fink needs a new face and with your help we might just get one.  We are curious to see what you imagine Fink to be as a graphical representation.
The initial announcement by Macnews is in German, for those of you not capable of reading German a translated version can be found
 <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/logo.php">here</a>. 
                </p>
<p>
Fink and MacWelt hope that many of you will participate as we might just find some prices for the winners. Good luck and.... start drawing.

still leaves some problems however.  If you upgrade Virex with Fink not
installed, and subsequently
wish to install Fink, you will need to delete the <code>/sw</code>

Fink already installed, you should immediately run
<b>
fink reinstall openssl-shlibs dlcompat-shlibs curl-ssl-shlibs

        The Virex 7.2 package, currently being distributed free to all .Mac 
members, has a serious conflict with Fink.  <b>Fink users should not install 
Virex 7.2 under any circumstances.</b>
  Installing it after Fink is installed
will damage your Fink installation; installing it prior to Fink will make
it impossible to install Fink without damaging Virex.

	<p>
	While Apple's X11 works just fine with existing binaries, it
has a bug in the install name of the libraries that can cause some
software to build incorrectly, and will break forward-compatibility
with future X11 releases.
</p>
<p>
	Ben Hines has created a script (available <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/fink/fix-fink/install_name_fix.pl">here</a>) that you can use
that will fix the install_name entries in Apple's X11 libraries,
but it will not repair software you have already built against the
broken libraries.
</p>
<p><b>Update 11 February 2003:</b> This script is not needed with 
version 0.2 of Apple's X11.app which was released yesterday.

	<p>
        A problem was uncovered today concerning the versions of imlib,
 libpng, and gnome in Fink's unstable tree.  The Fink team is hard at
 work addressing this problem.  As a workaround, users can downgrade
their imlib package to the stable version, "<code>fink install
 imlib-1.9.10-9</code>", until the problem is fixed.
</p><p>
   Many Fink users may be using Fink's unstable tree without being
fully aware of what this entails.  For a few months in the fall,
enabling the unstable tree was the only way to gain access to
 10.2-compatible versions of Fink packages.  
<b>That is no longer the case.</b>
Fink users who do not wish to help the Fink team with testing should
disable their unstable tree.  To do this, edit the file
<code>/sw/etc/fink.conf</code> and remove the items
 <code>unstable/main</code> and <code>unstable/crypto</code> from the
 <code>Trees</code> line.
	</p>
<p>The Fink team appreciates those users who are willing to stick with
the unstable tree, even when there are problems like today's, and provide
the team with prompt feedback.  This is a community effort and we
appreciate your participation.

  <p>
    Fink 0.5.0a for Mac OS X 10.2 is now complete. (Note: 0.5.0a is a final
    release, and replaces 0.5.0 which was never officially released.) This
    release includes over 700 
    binary packages for OS X 10.2 as well as over 1800 source packages of
    all kinds. 
  </p>
  <p>
      The source release and the binary installer are available now, as well as all binary packages. For information about upgrading, visit the <a href="<?php print $root; ?>download/upgrade.php">Upgrade Matrix</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>

project</a>.  If you are using Fink's
xfree86 packages, you should update to xfree86-base-4.2.1.1-1 and
xfree86-rootless-4.2.1.1-1.  These packages are recent additions to
the 10.2/unstable tree; to gain access to them, you may need to run

  <p>
  Users are cautioned to use the binary installer for Fink 0.4.1 <b>only
once</b> on a given machine.  Due to an apparent bug in Apple's
Installer.app program, attempting a second installation on the same
machine can result in permissions being altered in the machine's root
directory, in some cases leaving the machine in a non-bootable state.
</p><p> If Installer.app presents you with an "Upgrade" button rather
than an "Install" button when installing Fink 0.4.1, <b>do not proceed
any further!</b> </p>
<p>A new version of the binary installer for Fink 0.4.1 became available
on November 5.  The new version avoids
the problem of the machine not booting, but even with the new version,
users are advised to only "Install",
not "Upgrade."  (You can recognize the new version by its filesize of
12582912 bytes, while the old version had a filesize of 10541112 bytes.)

    <p>
      During the last few weeks, we got a lot of emails asking whether Fink will work Mac OS X 10.2.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer is: Yes, we will support 10.2. However, due to some
      major changes in this new OS version, we had to make a lot of adjustments both
      to the Fink tool itself and to many packages. The current binary distribution,
      0.4.0a, will only work partially on 10.2. We are working on an upgrade guide,
      as well as a new Fink release, to support 10.2.
    </p>
	<p>
	 If you upgrade your system to 10.2 before the official Fink update for 10.2 is ready,
	 many Fink packages built on 10.1 are going to work fine, but others need to be rebuilt.
	 Some packages need special changes to build on 10.2. Adding "unstable/main" to your
	 list of trees in /sw/etc/fink.conf (see also the <a href="<?php print $root; ?>faq/usage-fink.php#unstable">FAQ</a>)
	 will give you access to the latest versions of packages, many of which include important
	 fixes for 10.2.
	</p>
    <p>
     As of now, please do not email us asking about 10.2 support. If you can't wait,
     consult the <a href="<?php print $root; ?>lists/index.php">mailing list archives</a> instead.

    <p>
      All Fink users are urged to update their <b> passwd </b> package to version 20020329 or newer. Older versions of the <b> passwd </b> package are affected by a bug which could lead to the loss of all data on your hard disk if you remove system users created by Fink manually from the system via System Preferences. (Removing them via the NetInfo tool is safe.) You can check the version of your passwd package by entering <b> dpkg -s passwd</b>. If your version is outdated, you can update to the current one in two ways: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Via the binary distribution. First make sure you have the latest list of packages available: <b> sudo apt-get update</b>. Then you can perform the actual update: <b> sudo apt-get install passwd</b>. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Via the source distribution. First make sure you have the latest set of package descriptions: <b> fink selfupdate-cvs</b>. Then, update the passwd package: <b> fink update passwd</b> 
      </li>
    </ul>

      Due to a faulty script, the whole fink website, including our binary distro, has been wiped! This means you can't use the binary distro right now. I am working as quick as I can on uploading the new Fink 0.3.2 binary distro. In addition, the package database is not working for now. Please bear with us.
