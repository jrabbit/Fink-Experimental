如果你以前安装了 Java 1.4.1 及 Java SDK，苹果新的 Java 1.4.2 会升级Java 运行时到 1.4.2，
但会删除以前的 1.4.1 Java 运行时和 SDK，而没有 相应升级 JDK。要在 Fink 中构建 Java 软件包，
你需要到connect.apple.com 下载 Java 1.4.2 SDK(需要免费注册)。

许多针对 10.3 的二进制文件已经被更新，消除了 qt 和 kde 以及其它的一些问题。
要获取更新后的文件，运行 sudo apt-get update 命令来更新你的二进制文件索引。
在这之后，你可以使用 apt-get，dselect 或 FinkCommander 来象平常一样安装二进制文件。

	Thanks to the new Fink GNOME Core team, including a lot of hard work by packaging
	newcomer Keith Conger and GNOME 1.x maintainer Masanori Sekino, GNOME 2.4 has
	finally been released to the 10.3 unstable tree.
	
	
	It is there for the taking; please offer some of your time and test these packages
	if you are on unstable already.  Because of the massive number of changes, it is
	expected that there will be issues upgrading or installing the new GNOME.  If you
	have problems, you can reach the GNOME-savvy people at
	fink-gnome-core@lists.sourceforge.net.
	Please do report success stories there as well.  The more good reports we get, the
	faster GNOME 2.4 can be moved to stable.
	
	
	For those of you who do not read our mailing lists, why aren't you subscribed yet?
	Here is a link to detailed 
	instructions 
	how to install or upgrade GNOME and what new stuff it brings.

	A happy new year to all of you from the whole team. Blame this outburst of an 
	attempt at slang language on some of us having to watch the MTV Music Awards all
   day long.
	
	
	Last year has been a good year for Fink. We have had hard times keeping up with 
	the changes introduces by Apple, but we also learned that we have a great community
	which is willing to go through great lengths to support us. 
	For this, we say "Thank You". Much of what happens in the Fink project
   happens because of the amazing support and encouragement we get from our users.
	
	
	Two Zero Zero Four should not make us slow down, but speed up. There are some 
	interesting things in the pipeline, including GNOME 2.4, a new release of KDE, major 
	changes to the package manager itself, and organisational restructuring. 
	Hopefully we will advance into an even bigger project with developer conferences, 
	real life meetings, and a CD in your favourite shop.
	
	
	High ambitions can make one fall very deeply, thus we shall take it carefully, but 
	still we are all counting on your support during this year. Tell us what you think 
	about Fink; tell us what you like or dislike; show us ways to improve ourselves.
	Lend us your resources and sponsor a mirror or hardware. Devote some of your time
	to improve the package manager or add another piece of software by creating an
	info file. Browse this website and hopefully indulge yourself. We enjoy serving
	such a nice community; hopefully we shall make it a smooth ride for you and
	your Macintosh in Two Zero Zero Four.

	While we welcome our latest full mirror in Norway, sponsored by Havar Valeur, 
        we crave more. To improve our service to all of you, we would like to ask that
        you evaluate carefully if you maybe do have the resources to become a mirror. 
            
             
        All it takes is a 10Mbit link, around 100MB of disk space  and some bandwidth you are 
        willing to share for Fink. The exact setup instructions for rsync mirrors can be found 
        here. Especially mirrors in
        Asia, Australia, New Zealand, South Europe and Middle Europe are welcome, since we have none in 
        those regions yet. If you feel generous and wish to donate even more resources, please visit
        finkmirrors.net to learn about your options.
            
             
        The current status of all available rsync mirrors can be viewed on the finkmirrors.net pages as well.
        We hope to improve this service in the future, yet this depends on your willingness to help us out. 
        We are looking forward to many new applications and thank our community in advance.

    <title>Fink 0.6.2 released</title>
    <link>http://fink.sourceforge.net/news/#2003-11-17%20Fink%200.6.2</link>
    <dc:date>2003-11-17</dc:date>
    <description>
        The latest Fink release, version 0.6.2, is now available
for both source and binary users.  This is a bug-fix release, intended
to address two problems: the dselect/user deletion bug, and a 
problem with ownership of files.  The dselect bug was addressed by
updating the fink, dpkg, and apt packages.  After updating to 0.6.2,
it is safe to once again use dselect.  However, if you ran dselect
at any time since 0.6.0, you should carefully check the integrity
of the file at /sw/etc/apt/sources.list.  If you have
any doubts about this file, you should replace it with
the default sources.list file.

Users who have installed binary files from the 0.6.1 distribution
may find that certain files in their Fink installation are owned
by UID 2011 rather than by root.  To correct this problem,
run the command:
sudo find /sw/ -user 2011 -exec chown root:admin {} \;
This release, like the previous one, was built on OS X 10.2
using the gcc 3.3 compiler, and runs fine with some exceptions* on OS X 10.3.  Most Fink 
users who upgrade to 10.3 will continue to
want to only use the binaries from this
new distribution for now, while the Fink team continues to modify
Fink packages for 10.3.

*Exceptions include: emacs, qt.

    <description>
Quick Summary: DO NOT USE DSELECT, and if you've used it,
check your /sw/etc/apt/sources.list file carefully.
		Users who have bootstrapped or installed Fink 0.5.3 or Fink 0.6.0
		on Mac OS X 10.3 could exhibit a problem where all users get deleted
		from the netinfo database, and you become unable to log in.
We believe that this problem can only occur if you've used dselect.
		If you are using Mac OS X 10.3, please be sure you're using the
		latest Fink version to avoid the issue.  To make sure you don't have
		upgrade problems, check your /sw/etc/apt/sources.list
		file.  You will need to modify it if it contains deb
		lines that point to "release" or "current" without a version number.
		In other words, if your sources.list file contains
		these lines:
		deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download release main
deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download current main
		...you should change them to this:
		deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download 10.3/release main
deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download 10.3/current main
		We are working on updating the repository to make sure that even
		if you update you don't get the broken code, and to
repair dselect, but in the meantime,
		make sure your sources.list file has the correct entries.
Other users have experienced problems with dselect itself, particularly
complaints about a missing "darwin" package.  If you are running dselect
under 10.3 and you don't get this warning, then your 
sources.list file is likely to be corrupted and you should
repair it as above.

        The latest Fink release, version 0.6.1, is now available
for both source and binary users.  This release was built on OS X 10.2
using the gcc 3.3 compiler, and runs well on OS X 10.3.  Most Fink
users who upgrade to 10.3 will want to only use the binaries from this
new distribution for now, while the Fink team continues to modify
Fink packages for 10.3.

If you wish to access the 
new binaries, use apt-get, dselect, or the binary mode of
FinkCommander.  Unless you are interested in helping the Fink team
to test packages which are compiled on 10.3, 
do not use the command-line fink program to do your
installations for the
next few weeks.

The simplest way to upgrade a binary installation is to run
"sudo apt-get update".  Further details and
other issues related to upgrading Fink to 10.3 are addressed on the
Special 10.3 upgrade page.

Before using the latest version of
the command-line fink program 
under OS X 10.2, be sure to install the August2003gccUpdater, available
after free registration from connect.apple.com.

		We wish all of you a happy Halloween.
		
		
		Furthermore I would like to welcome our new mirrors to the Fink family.
		From Europe in Rijeka, Croatia a new full mirror joins us. This mirrors 
		has been sponsored by the Jabucnjak Apple user group. 
		This is our first mirror in Europe, so I hope that more will be joining us 
		soon.
		
		
		Dave Schroeder from the University of 
		Wisconsin in Madison is sponsoring a 100Mbit dedicated Master server.
		A. J. Wright and SunSITE@UTK are helping out with 
		another full mirror in the United states. 
		
		
		This raises our full mirror count to four and the rsync mirror count to 
		five. We are happy to have such a great community back us up, but I know 
		that more mirrors will join over time. I will not stop nagging you until
		Fink has its own mirror in every state of the USA. Yet, with such a 
		brilliant community backing us up, I am not too worried about not
		reaching my goal very soon.
		
		
		Trick or treat! Our most wanted treat is more mirrors, so come forth 
		Administrators and fill our bag. Information on how you can be a mirror
		can be found on the official 
		mirroring website.

	As you surely noticed, Fink has a logo. This is the result of our

	This new, official, logo has been displayed since the 24th of October and

	The longer explanation also features a larger version of the logo itself,
	so that you may have a closer look at its details. We like our new logo,
	we hope that you will like it too.
	
	IMPORTANT: We do not yet have a formal licensing agreement for the new
   logo and so are unable to give permission to distribute it.  Currently, it
   can only be displayed on the Fink web page.  Thank you for your understanding.

	It is now possible to upgrade Fink to take full advantage of the gcc 3.3
compiler, or to use OS X 10.3 if you have that installed.  Binary packages
corresponding to these upgrades are not yet available, so if you make 
extensive use of binary packages you may wish to wait a few days before 
upgrading.

If you wish to perform this upgrade, and you had previously installed the
June 2003 Developer Tools update from Apple, you will need to install
the August 2003 Developer Tools update BEFORE you upgrade Fink.  Under
10.3, be sure to install XCode from the XCode disk before upgrading
Fink.

Running "fink selfupdate" should perform the upgrade for you.  The latest
version of the fink package manager will automatically detect which
version of OS X and which version of gcc you have installed, and will
adjust itself accordingly.

If you wish to do a fresh install of Fink on a 10.3 system, we recommend
bootstrapping from
source, starting from fink-full-0.6.0.tar.gz available
on fink's sourceforge 
download page.  You'll need XCode for this as
well.

Also note that once you have Fink version 0.15.0 or higher, you do
not need to install system-xfree86 anymore.  Fink is
capable of automatically determining your system-xfree86 version if you
don't already have any fink x11 packages installed.  If you currently
have an old system-xfree86 package of any kind installed, please run the
following:

sudo dpkg -r --force-all system-xfree86 system-xfree86-42 \
system-xfree86-43; fink selfupdate; fink index

The Fink team is still working on getting Fink packages working under 10.3,
but many many packages already work.
