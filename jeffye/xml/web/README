In addition to the php files for the web site, this directory stores
information about the version number of the latest (complete) Fink 
distribution, which is consulted by users' copies of Fink when using the 
"point" update method.

These days, each complete Fink distribution is tuned to a particular
"tree", such as 10.2-gcc3.3.  As of this writing, there are three files
containing tree-specific version information:

  CURRENT-FINK-10.2 (most likely frozen forever with value "0.5.4")
  CURRENT-FINK-10.2-gcc3.3
  CURRENT-FINK-10.3

The users' copy of Fink consults the "Distibution:" line in /sw/etc/fink.conf
in order to decide which of these version numbers to fetch.

To maintain compatibility with earlier versions of this system, the
directory also contains two legacy files:
  LATEST-FINK (with the value "0.4.1a", used by 10.1)
  CURRENT-FINK (with the value "0.5.4", used by 10.2 in upgrading to
                the tree-specific system described above.)


NOTE:  For use on the web site, the current fink version number must also be 
supplied in three places: fink_version.inc, xml/finkdoc.dtd, xml/finkfaq.dtd.


IMPORTANT NOTE: As of 29 June 2003, the CVS modules have been somewhat
rearranged.  It is no longer advisible to check out the "web" module from
CVS.  If you want the website contents, check out the "website" module.
If you want to be able to edit the documentation, including the website,
check out the "xml" module.
