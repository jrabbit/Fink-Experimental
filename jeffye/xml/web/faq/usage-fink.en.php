<h1>F.A.Q. - 5 Installing, Using and Maintaining Fink</h1>
    
    
    <a name="what-packages">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q5.1: How can I find out what packages
Fink supports?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 
Since Fink 0.2.3, there is the <code>list</code> command.
It produces a list of all packages known to your Fink installation.
Example:
</p><pre>fink list</pre><p>
If you're using the binary distribution, <code>dselect</code> gives
you a nice browsable listing of available packages.
Note that you must run it as root if you want to select and install
packages from within dselect.
</p><p>
There's also the <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/pdb/">package
database</a> at the website.
</p></div>
    </a>
    <a name="proxy">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q5.2: I'm behind a firewall. How do I
configure Fink to use an HTTP proxy?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> The <code>fink</code> command supports explicit proxy settings that
are passed on to <code>wget</code>/<code>curl</code>.
If you were not asked for proxies on first time installation, you can
run <code>fink configure</code> to set it up.
You can also run that command at any time to reconfigure the
<code>fink</code> command.
If you followed the instructions in the installation guide, and use
<code>/sw/bin/init.csh</code> (or <code>/sw/bin/init.sh</code>),
then <code>apt-get</code> and <code>dselect</code> also will use these
proxy settings. Make sure that you put the protocol in front of the proxy, e.g.</p><pre>ftp://proxy.yoursite.somewhere</pre><p>If you are still having problems, go into System Preferences, select the Network pane, select the Proxies tab, and make sure that the box labeled "Use Passive FTP Mode (PASV)" is checked.</p></div>

    <a name="firewalled-cvs">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q5.3: How do I update available packages from CVS when I am behind a firewall?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> The package <b>cvs-proxy</b> can tunnel through HTTP proxies.</p><ul>
          <li>
            <p>First download the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/fink/dists/10.2/unstable/main/finkinfo/devel/">cvs-proxy</a> files (an .info file and a .patch file) and place them into your local tree (i.e. /sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo/).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Install the <b>cvs-proxy</b> package with the command:</p>
            <p>
              <code>fink install <b>cvs-proxy</b>
              </code>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Packages are then updated with the commands:</p>
            <p>
              <code>fink selfupdate-cvs</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>fink update-all</code>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul><p>If fink is not configured to use your proxy, change the settings using:</p><p>
          <code>fink configure</code>.</p></div>
    </a>
    <a name="moving">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q5.4: Can I move Fink to another
location after installation?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 
No.
Well, of course you can move the files using mv or the Finder, but 99%
of the programs will stop working when you do.
That's because basically all Unix software depends on hardcoded paths
to find data files, libraries and other stuff.
</p></div>
    </a>
    <a name="moving-symlink">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q5.5: If I move Fink after
installation and provide a symlink from the old location, will it
work?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 
Maybe.
The general expectation is that it should work, but there may be
hidden traps somewhere.
</p></div>
    </a>
    <a name="removing">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q5.6: How can I uninstall all of Fink?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 
Almost all files installed by Fink are in /sw (or wherever you chose
to install it). Thus in order to get rid of Fink, enter this command:
</p><pre>sudo rm -rf /sw</pre><p>
The only exception to this rule is XFree86. If you installed XFree86 through
Fink (i.e., you installed the <code>xfree86</code> or 
<code>xfree86-rootless</code> packages,
instead of using <code>system-xfree86</code>) and want to remove it, you 
will need additionally to enter this:
</p><pre>sudo rm -rf /usr/X11R6 /etc/X11 /Applications/XDarwin.app</pre><p>If you aren't planning to reinstall Fink you also will want to remove 
the "<code>source 
/sw/bin/init.csh</code>" line you added to your 
<code>.cshrc</code> file or the 
"<code>source /sw/bin/init.sh</code>" line you added to your 
<code>.bashrc</code> file, whichever is appropriate to your setup,  
using a text editor.</p></div>
    </a>
    <a name="bindist">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q5.7: The package database at the
website lists package xxx, but apt-get and dselect know nothing about
it. Who's lying?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 
Both are correct.
The <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/pdb/">package database</a>
knows about every package, including those that are still in the
unstable section.
The <code>dselect</code> and <code>apt-get</code> tools on the other
hand only know about the packages available as precompiled binary
packages.
Many packages are not available in precompiled form through these
tools for a variety of reasons.
A package must be in the "stable" section of the latest point release
to be considered, and it must pass additional checks for policy
compliance as well as licensing and patent restrictions.
</p><p>
If you want to install a package that is not available via
<code>dselect</code> / <code>apt-get</code>, you have to compile it
from source using <code>fink install <b>packagename</b>
          </code>.
Make sure you have the Developer Tools installed before you try this.
(If there is no installer for the Developer Tools in your
<code>/Applications</code> folder, you can get them from the <a href="http://connect.apple.com/">Apple Developer Connection</a> after free registration.)
See also the question about unstable below.
</p></div>
    </a>
    <a name="unstable">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q5.8: There's this package in unstable that I want to install, but the fink command just says 'no package found'. How can I install it?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> First make sure you understand what 'unstable' means. Packages in the unstable tree usually have not been tested by more than a few people. For that reason, Fink doesn't search the unstable tree by default.  If you do enable unstable, please remember to e-mail the maintainer if something works (or even if it doesn't).  Feedback from users like you is what we use to determine if something is ready for stable!  To find out the maintainer of a package, run <code>fink info &lt;packagename&gt;</code>.</p><p>Packages often have dependencies, and packages in unstable often depend on other packages in unstable. For that reason, it is best to activate all of unstable.</p><p>If you want Fink to use all of unstable, edit <code>/sw/etc/fink.conf</code>, add <code>unstable/main</code> and <code>unstable/crypto</code> to the <code>Trees:</code> line, and then run <code>fink selfupdate; fink index</code>.</p><p>If you only want one or two specific packages, and nothing else from unstable, then you need to switch over to CVS updating (i.e. use <code>fink selfupdate-cvs</code>), because rsync only updates the trees that are active in your <code>fink.conf</code>. 
		Edit <code>/sw/etc/fink.conf</code> and add <code>local/main</code> to the <code>Trees:</code> line, if not present. Then you'll need to run <code>fink selfupdate</code> to download the package description files. Now copy the relevant <code>.info</code> files 
		(and their associated <code>.patch</code> files, if there are any) from <code>/sw/fink/dists/unstable/main/finkinfo</code> (or <code>/sw/fink/dists/unstable/crypto/finkinfo</code>) to <code>/sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo</code>. However, note that your package may depend on other packages (or particular 
		versions) which are also only in unstable.  You will have to move their <code>.info</code> and <code>.patch</code> files as well.  After you move all of the files, make sure to run <code>fink index</code>, so that Fink's record of available packages is updated.
		Once you're done you can switch back to rsync (<code>fink selfupdate-rsync</code>) if you want.</p></div>

    <a name="sudo">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q5.9: I'm tired of typing my password into sudo again
and again. Is there a way around this?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> If you're not paranoid, you can configure sudo to not ask you for a
password. To do this, edit <code>/etc/sudoers</code> as root
and add a line like this:</p><pre>username ALL = NOPASSWD: ALL</pre><p>Replace <code>username</code> with your actual username, of course. This
line allows you to run any command via sudo without typing your
password.</p></div>

    <a name="exec-init-csh">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q5.10: When I try to run init.csh or init.sh, I get a "Permission denied" error. What am I doing wrong?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> init.csh and init.sh are not supposed to be run like normal commands. These files set environment variables like PATH and MANPATH in your shell. To have a lasting effect on the shell, it must be processed with the <code>source</code> command for csh/tcsh, or with the <code>.</code> command for bash/zsh, like this:</p><p>for csh/tcsh:</p><pre>source /sw/bin/init.csh</pre><p>for bash/zsh:</p><pre>. /sw/bin/init.sh</pre></div>
    </a>
    <a name="dselect-access">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q5.11: Help! I used the
"[A]ccess" menu entry in dselect and now I can't download packages any
more!</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 
You probably pointed apt at a Debian mirror, which of course doesn't
have the Fink files.
You can fix this manually or through dselect.
To fix it manually, edit the file
<code>/sw/etc/apt/sources.list</code> in a text editor as root.
Remove lines that mention debian.org and replace them with these:
</p><pre>deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download release main crypto
deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download current main crypto</pre><p>
(Or if you live in Europe, you can use <code>eu.dl.sourceforge.net</code>
instead of <code>us.dl.sourceforge.net</code>)
</p><p>
To fix it through dselect, run "[A]ccess" again, choose the "apt"
method and enter the following info:
</p><p>
URL: http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download -
Distribution: release -
Components: main crypto
</p><p>
Then, say you want to add another source and repeat the process with
"current" instead of "release".
</p><p>
A fixed version of the apt package (which provides the configuration
script as a plug-in for dselect) is making it's way through CVS now.

freezes up/kernel panics/dies. Help!</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b>  A number of recent reports on the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum=fink-users">fink-users

infinite hangs during patching) when using Fink to compile packages while
anti-virus software is installed. You may need to switch off any anti-virus
software before using Fink.

    <a name="not-found">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q5.14: I'm trying to install a package, but Fink can't download it. The download site shows a later version number of the package than what Fink has. What do I do?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> The package sources get moved around by the upstream sites when new
versions are released.</p><p>The first thing you should do is run <code>fink selfupdate</code>.
It may be that the package maintainer has already fixed this, and you will
get an updated package description with either a more recent version or a
revised download URL.</p><p>If this doesn't work, most sources are available on <a href="http://distfiles.master.finkmirrors.net/">http://distfiles.master.finkmirrors.net/</a> (thanks to Rob Braun) , and you can run <code>fink configure</code> to choose to search "Master" source mirrors so that Fink will automatically look there.</p><p>If this doesn't work, please let the package maintainer (available from "<code>fink describe <b>packagename</b>
          </code>") know that the URL is broken; not all maintainers read the mailing lists all of the time.</p><p>To get a usable source, first try hunting around the remote site in
other directories for the same version of the source that Fink wants 
(e.g. in an "old"
directory). Keep in mind, though, that some remote sites like to trash the
old versions of their packages. If the official site doesn't have it, then
try a web search--sometimes there are unofficial sites that have the 
tarball you want. Another place to look is <a href="http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download/source/">http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download/source/</a>, 
which is where Fink stores sourcefiles from packages that have been 
released in binary form. If all of the above fail, then you might consider posting on the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum=fink-users">fink-users
mailing list</a> to ask if anybody has the old source available to give
you. </p><p>Once you locate the proper source tarball, download it manually, and then move the file into your Fink source location (i.e. for a default Fink install, "<code>sudo mv <b>package-source.tar.gz</b> /sw/src/</code>". Then use '<code>fink install <b>packagename</b>
          </code>' as normal.</p><p>If you can't get the source file, then you'll have to wait for the maintainer to deal with the problem. They may either post a link to the old source, or update the .info and .patch files to use the newer version.

    <a name="fink-not-found">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q5.15: I get "command not found" errors when I run Fink or anything that I installed with Fink.</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> If this always happens, then you may have inadvertently modified your startup scripts.  Run the <code>/sw/bin/pathsetup.command</code> script (either by double-clicking in the Finder or in a terminal), which will attempt to detect your startup configuration.  You'll then need to open a new terminal session so that your environment settings are loaded.</p><p>On the other hand, if you only have problems in the Apple X11 terminal, this probably means that you need to create a <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/doc/x11/run-xfree86.php#xinitrc">.xinitrc</a> file and add the line</p><pre>. /sw/bin/init.sh</pre><p>near the beginning (i.e. before any programs get run).  Restart X11 (if running) after you do this.</p></div>

      <div class="question"><p><b>Q5.16: I want to hide /sw in the Finder to keep users from damaging the Fink setup.</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> You can indeed do this. If you have the Development Tools installed, then you can run the following command:</p><pre>sudo /Developer/Tools/SetFile -a V /sw</pre><p>This makes /sw invisible, just like the standard system folders (/usr, etc.). If you don't have the Developer Tools, there are various third-party applications that let you manipulate file attributes--you need to set /sw to be invisible.</p></div>

      <div class="question"><p><b>Q5.17: I can't install anything, because I get the following error: "install-info: unrecognized option `--infodir=/sw/share/info'"</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> This usually is due to a problem in your PATH. In a terminal window type:</p><pre>printenv PATH</pre><p>If <code>/sw/sbin</code> doesn't appear at all, then you need to set your environment up as per the <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/doc/users-guide/install.php#setup">instructions</a> in the Users Guide. If <code>/sw/sbin</code> is there, but there are other directories ahead of it (e.g. <code>/usr/local/bin</code>), then you will either want to reorder your PATH so that <code>/sw/sbin</code> is near the beginning, or if you really need the other directory to be before <code>/sw/sbin</code>, then you'll want to temporarily rename the other <code>install-info</code> when you use Fink.</p></div>

    <a name="bad-list-file">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q5.18: I can't install or remove anything, because of a problem with a "files list file".</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> Typically these errors take the form:</p><pre>files list file for package <b>packagename</b> contains empty filename</pre><p>or</p><pre>files list file for package <b>packagename</b> is missing final newline</pre><p>This can be fixed, with a little work. If you have the .deb file for the offending package currently available on your system, then check its integrity by running</p><pre>dpkg --contents <b>full-path-to-debfile</b>
        </pre><p>e.g.</p><pre>dpkg --contents /sw/fink/debs/libgnomeui2-dev_2.0.6-2_darwin-powerpc.deb</pre><p>If you get back a listing of directories and files, then your .deb is OK. If the output is something other than directories and files, or if you don't have the .deb file, you can still proceed because the error doesn't interfere with builds.</p><p>If you have been installing from the binary distribution or you know for sure that the version in the binary distribution is the same as what you have installed (e.g. by checking the <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/pdb/index.php">package database</a>), then you can get a .deb file by running <code>sudo apt=get install --reinstall --download-only <b>packagename</b>
          </code>. Otherwise you can build one yourself by running <code>fink rebuild <b>packagename</b>
          </code>, but it won't install yet.</p><p>Once you have a valid .deb file, then you can reconstitute the file. First become root by using <code>sudo -s</code> (enter your administrative user password if necessary), and then use the following command (on one line--it's split for readability here):</p><pre>dpkg -c <b>full-path-to-debfile</b>
  | awk '{if ($6 == "./"){ print "/."; } else if (substr($6, length($6), 1) == "/")
    {print substr($6, 2, length($6) - 2); } else { print substr($6, 2, length($6) - 1);}}' 
  &gt; /sw/var/lib/dpkg/info/<b>packagename</b>.list</pre><p>e.g.</p><pre>dpkg -c /sw/fink/debs/libgnomeui2-dev_2.0.6-2_darwin-powerpc.deb

      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> The number 19 appears because your OS X system is localized to a language
other than English. (This is a bug in Apple's Installer, that it doesn't
just show you the English-language error message.)</p><p>The English language error message corresponding to number 19 is</p><p>"A root directory /sw exists.

If you haven't installed Fink before, the most likely cause of this
is that you installed the Virex program available for free to .Mac users.

the Virex folks having made errors in the way they set things up).</p></div>

You should update Fink.  During the process you will be prompted to install either <code>perl-core</code> or <code>system-perl</code>; choose the latter. 
In addition, <code>storable-pm</code> should also get updated.</p><p>For OS 10.1.x, perform the following commands (you'll need the Developer Tools):</p><pre>sudo mv /sw/lib/perl5/darwin/Storable.pm /tmp
sudo mv /sw/lib/perl5/darwin/auto/Storable /tmp
fink rebuild storable-pm

      <div class="question"><p><b>Q5.25: I've changed my OS | Developer Tools, but Fink doesn't recognize the change.</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> When changing the Fink distribution (of which the source and binary distros are subsets), Fink needs to be told that this has happened.  To do this, you can run a script that normally gets run when you first install Fink:</p><pre>/sw/lib/fink/postinstall.pl</pre><p>Doing this will point Fink to the correct place.</p></div>

      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> What happened is that somehow the OSX Terminal program has been told to run <code>/sw/bin/pathsetup.command</code> every time you log in.
