IMPORTANT NOTE: As of 29 June 2003, the CVS modules have been somewhat
rearranged.  It is no longer advisible to check out the "web" module from
CVS.  If you want the website contents, check out the "website" module.
If you want to be able to edit the documentation, including the website,
check out the "xml" module.


 README for XML Documents
==========================

This directory and its subdirectories contain the XML source of the
various documents of the Fink project, plus various XSLT stylesheets
for rendering:

 * finkdoc-website.xsl renders to HTML for the website. The script
   postprocess.pl adds the required PHP wrapper. Multiple pages /
   files are generated for <document> documents.

 * finkdoc-html.xsl renders to pure, monolithic HTML for inclusion
   with the distribution and for printing.

 * finkdoc-text.xsl renders to ASCII text via an intermediary XML
   format. The textify.pl script does the actual text rendering. This
   is also for inclusion with the distribution.

To render the documents, you need xsltproc, available in the "libxslt"
package in Fink (we used to use Saxon, but xsltproc is much much faster).
You also need xmllint from the "libxml2" package in Fink.
You can then use the provided Makefiles to render the documents. There
are .cvsignore files to keep CVS from complaining about generated files.
