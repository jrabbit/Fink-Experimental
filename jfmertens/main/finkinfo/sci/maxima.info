DescDetail: << 
Maxima is a symbolic computation program. It is full featured, including
symbolic manipulation of polynomials, matrices, rational functions,
integration, Todd-coxeter, 2D and 3D plotting, an ODE solver, and bigfloats.
It containss a symbolic source level debugger for maxima code.
Maxima is based on the original MACsyma developed at MIT in the 1970's.

DescUsage: <<
Enter "rmaxima" for a command line interface, or "xmaxima" for a
graphical Tk-based interface.
<<

DescPort: <<
IMPORTANT: Maxima will only reliably work with the version (and
revision) of CLISP that was used to build it.  For that reason, this
pacakge has a versioned dependency on Fink's CLISP package.

xmaxima -l sbcl still gives trouble, even with latest sbcl

Previous versions maintained by William McCallum, Matthias Neeracher, and
Andrea Riciputi.
