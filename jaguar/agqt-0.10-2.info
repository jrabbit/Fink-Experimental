Description: 6's Spiffy AudioGalaxy Query Tool
DescDetail: <<
 6's Spiffy AudioGalaxy Query Tool is a package that automates queries to 
 the AudioGalaxy music sharing system. It enables you to queue any song 
 (at a minimum configurable bitrate) with one command line, even if the 
 AudioGalaxy site is busy or unresponsive. It will also allow you to queue most 
 full albums with one command line, by going on AllMusic.Com to look up the 
 song list, and queueing up each of the songs listed. 
<<
DescPort:<<
 Replacing g++ by c++ had to be done twice, because g++ is also used by the 
 implicit rules of make.
 Stacksize had to be upped from the default 512kB. Thanks to Finlay Dobbie and
 Peter O'Gorman for showing how to do this.
 A patch from the sourceforge agqt project is included in the patch file
 that adds the "show-tracks" option to am and the "agrename.pl" script.
<<
DescUsage:<<
 The 4 command line tools "ag", "am", "fdb", and "agrename.pl" print short 
   usage instructions when used without arguments.
 The README file contains detailed instructions for the usage of the two
   command line tools "ag" and "am".
 "fdb" is new since version 0.9; it is like "am", except it uses FreeDB instead 
   of AllMusic Guide. 
 The "hammer" utility is included now, too. 
   See the ChangeLog file for a description.
   
 Version 0.10 now contains the tcl/tk based GUI agqt.tcl. 
   To use it, you have to have the fink package tcltk installed.
   You need to have X11 running.
   To start the GUI, type "agqt.tcl".
   
 You need to create a .agrc file in your home directory. 
   A sample file "agrc.sample" is supplied.
