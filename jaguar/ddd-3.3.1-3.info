Description: Graphical front-end for command-line debuggers
DescDetail: <<
GNU DDD is a graphical front-end for command-line debuggers such as
GDB, DBX, WDB, Ladebug, JDB, XDB, the Perl debugger, or the Python
debugger. Besides ``usual'' front-end features such as viewing
source texts, DDD has become famous through its interactive graphical
data display, where data structures are displayed as graphs.
<<
DescPort: <<
There is a case problem: on a HFS+ filesystem, "ddd" and "Ddd" clash. We use
a trick to get around this limitation.
