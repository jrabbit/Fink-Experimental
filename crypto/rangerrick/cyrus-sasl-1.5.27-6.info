Package: cyrus-sasl
Version: 1.5.27
Revision: 6
Description: Cyrus Simple Authentication and Security Layer Library.
DescDetail: <<
SASL is the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, a method for adding 
authentication support to connection-based protocols. To use SASL, a protocol 
includes a command for identifying and authenticating a user to a server and 
for optionally negotiating protection of subsequent protocol interactions. If 
its use is negotiated, a security layer is inserted between the protocol and 
the connection. 
<<
DescPort: <<
Due to a conflict with the essential fink package "dpkg", the include files 
for cyrus-sasl have been moved to a directory "include/cyrus-sasl/".  This
may affect other packages which depend on this one.
