Description: Perl extension for working with chemical elements
DescDetail: <<
 Chemistry::Elements provides an easy, object-oriented way to keep track of
your chemical data.  Using either the atomic number, chemical symbol, or
element name you can construct an Element object.  Once you have an element
object, you can associate your data with the object by making up your own
methods, which the AUTOLOAD function handles.  Since each chemist is likely
to want to use his or her own data, or data for some unforesee-able
property, this module does not try to be a repository for chemical data.
