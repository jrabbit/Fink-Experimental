Description: Clam Anti-virus scanner
DescDetail: <<
 Clam AntiVirus is an anti-virus scanner written from scratch. It is
 licensed under GNU GPL2 and uses the virus database from
 OpenAntiVirus, which is an another free anti-virus project. In
 contrast to the OpenAntiVirus which is written in Java, Clam
 AntiVirus is written entirely in C and is POSIX compliant.
<<
DescUsage: <<
 `clamscan -h` Outputs help information and exits.
 
 For virus updates, run `freshclam` as superuser from a shell prompt
 or in a cron script.

 Clamav handles most archive formats except those of unrar 3, for
 which it requires the unrar program.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 Built with --disable-clamav to allow clamscan to run without
 superuser permissions.

 However, clamscan still requires a user named 'clamav' to run in
 superuser mode regardless of how it was built. (Important when
 running the post-build tests because fink runs as root).
 
 During the test the virus database isn't actually installed yet so
 the one in the build directory is specified.
<<
DescPort: <<
 Shared libraries disabled by '--enable-shared=no' so the program can
 be prebound. No other programs use libclam yet anyway.
 
 Note that the newer clamav 0.54 does not build properly on Mac OS X,
 it cannot scan inside archives without help from external utilities.
