 TODO: make this work with Sourceforge urls. Right now it is only partially useful to help you decide on which debian mirror to use, but you need to edit /sw/etc/fink.conf manualy and restore your previous /sw/etc/apt/sources.list.bak yourself.
 
 Would be nice for this program to automatically handle all the various mirrors handled by fink. Email me if you would like to help with this.
