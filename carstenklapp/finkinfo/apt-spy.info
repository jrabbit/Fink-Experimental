 TODO: make this work with Sourceforge urls. Right now it is only
 partially useful to help you decide on which debian mirror to use,
 but you need to edit /sw/etc/fink.conf manualy and restore your
 previous /sw/etc/apt/sources.list.bak yourself.
 
 Would be nice for this program to automatically handle all the
 various mirrors handled by fink. Email me if you would like to help
 with this.

DescUsage: <<
 This package does not work with Fink yet!

 The "area" code has been patched but the "country" code needs a lot
 more work.

 If somehow you manage to get far enough, apt-spy will backup your
 /sw/etc/apt/sources.list to /sw/etc/apt/sources.list.bak. Best to
 back up /sw/etc/apt/sources.list to somewhere else before playing
 with this program as-is.

 Please email me if you are able to help rewrite/hack 'parse.c' to
 read the Fink mirrors from the files /sw/lib/fink/mirrors/_keys and
 /sw/lib/fink/mirrors/sourceforge, for someone like me with little C
 experience it's been tough so far. :)
