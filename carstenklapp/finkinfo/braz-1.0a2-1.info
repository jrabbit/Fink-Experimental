** WARNING **

 I'm working with the author to put out a version (1.0a3) which will be friendly to Mac OS resource forks. In the mean time, BE CAREFUL, YOU CAN EASILY DESTROY ALL YOUR CLASSIC & CARBON APPLICATIONS, SYSTEM FOLDER AND DOCUMENTS if you blindly run this program without understanding the consequences.
 
 If a file appears to be 0 bytes in the shell but the Finder says otherwise, it probably has a resource fork so DON'T RUN BRAZ in that directory!
