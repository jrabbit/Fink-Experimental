DescDetail: <<
 braz searches in the file-tree rooted at the current working
 directory for identical regular files without crossing file-system
 boundaries. Files found identical are hard-linked together.

* WARNING * 
 Serious consequences such as SEVERE DATA LOSS will occur when this
 program is used incorrectly. Make sure you are well informed before
 using braz, read all of the usage instructions and enclosed
 documentation.

DescUsage: <<
* WARNING *

 YOU CAN EASILY DESTROY ALL YOUR CLASSIC & CARBON APPLICATIONS, SYSTEM
 FOLDER AND DOCUMENTS if you blindly run this program without
 understanding the consequences. BRAZ WORKS FAST, AND HAS NO UNDO!

* Read all of the braz documentation and man page before even typing
  'braz -h' in the terminal.

 If you are not 100% sure about the difference between a resource fork
 and a data fork, you will be better off using a nice safe program
 with a graphical-interface like "File Buddy" to eliminate duplicate
 files on your hard drive. (Look for it on VersionTracker.com).

 Files with only a resource fork appear as zero-byte files to the unix
 part of Mac OS X, therefore DO NOT USE the -0 option "Accept nul
 sized files" unless you absolutely know what you are doing!

 When two files or applications have the same data-fork but different
 resource-forks, Braz will still see them as the same file and
 hard-link them together anyway. Although this scenario is not common
 it does happen, for example:

 You have multiple copies of one PowerPC, FAT or Carbon application in
 various places on your hard drive. The code (data fork) is the same,
 but you've customized all the icons and PICTs in one of the copies
 and keep the others for backup. Braz will keep one and destroy the
 others, replacing them with hard-links.

 You have a set of images, sounds and QuickTime movies, many are
 duplicates. Some movies have selections saved into the resource fork
 with QuickTime player, images have custom icons and previews in the
 resource fork, and the sounds have various marker data from SoundEdit
 in the resource forks. Braz only compares data forks, so pay
 attention! When there is no data fork Braz 1.0a3 will ignore the file
 by default on Mac OS X because it appears to be zero bytes long.

 If a file appears to be 0 bytes in the shell but the Finder says
 otherwise, it probably has a resource fork. To make things simple
 just don't run braz in that directory.

 If in doubt, run Braz first with the -n or -s options and -vv to
 simulate the operation, then examine the output THOROUGHLY.

 Finally, don't even think about running this from the root dir as
 superuser, braz can become confused by /dev.

 I am working with the author to put out a version (1.0a3) which will
 be friendly to Mac OS resource forks, but don't expect anything
 soon. In the mean time, BE MINDFUL OF YOUR RESOURCE FORKS, I love
 them as much as you do (well, maybe more).
