Package: whereis
Version: 1.8
Revision: 1
Description: Search for binaries, man pages and source directories
DescDetail: <<
 The whereis command appeared in 3.0BSD. This version re-implements
 the historical functionality that was lost in 4.4BSD, and was
 rewritten from scratch for FreeBSD after the 4.3BSD manual page.

 bash users may appreciate this updated 'whereis' command more than
 tcsh users, tcsh already has a relatively functional 'where' command
 built into the shell. (The original whereis command is limited to
 searching the path defined in `sysctl user.cs_path`, a read-only
 sysctl value which requires a kernel recompilation to change).

 The whereis utility checks the standard binary, manual page, and
 source directories for the specified programs, printing out the paths
 of any it finds. The supplied names are first stripped of leading
 path name components, any single trailing extension added by gzip(1)
 or compress(1), and the leading 's.' or trailing ',v' from a source
 code control system.

 The default path searched is the string returned by the sysctl(8)
 utility for the "user.cs_path" string, with /usr/libexec and the
 current user's $PATH appended. Manual pages are searched by default
 along the $MANPATH. Program sources are located in a list of known
 standard places, including all the subdirectories of /usr/src and
 /usr/ports.

DescPort: <<
 FreeBSD-current (i.e. unstable) is testing a new whereis based on
 this perl script but rewritten in C. It does not compile properly on Mac OS X
 10.2.6, but hack it like this (disables reading of sysctl user.cs_path):
 /*
 if (sysctlbyname("user.cs_path"
 ...
 err(EX_OSERR
 */
