Description: Site config.cache for automake configure results
DescDetail: <<
 By default, configure uses ./config.cache as the cache file, creating
 it if it does not exist already. You can give configure the
 --cache-file=FILE option or set the environment variable CONFIG_SITE
 to use a different cache file; that is what configure does when it
 calls configure scripts in subdirectories, so they share the cache.
 
 Giving --cache-file=/dev/null disables caching, for debugging
 configure. config.status only pays attention to the cache file if you
 give it the --recheck option to rerun configure.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Some Suggestions If You Have Any ./configure Errors:

Try 'fink reinstall %n'. This will filter some cache entries known to be problematic with fink.
Try 'unsetenv CACHE_SITE' and build again.
Failing that:
- manually edit %p/var/cache/automake/%n
- delete CFLAGS lines (or whichever indicated by the ./configure error)
  or substitute those two lines with:
  ac_cv_env_CFLAGS_set=${ac_cv_env_CFLAGS_set=set}
  ac_cv_env_CFLAGS_value=${ac_cv_env_CFLAGS_value=-I/sw/include}
  (maybe a better PostInstScript to automate this)
- Try again
Finally, uninstall via: sudo fink purge config.site
