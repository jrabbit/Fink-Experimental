<h1>Help Wanted</h1>

<p> First, try BMan's <strong>totally awesome</strong> <a href="http://sherlock.clan-mac.com/channels.html">VersionTracker plugin for Sherlock 3</a>. It would be cool to have a Jaguar Sherlock plugin like this for Fink, no?</p>

<p>Please feel free to commit to cvs for this plugin whenever you want, personally I'm finding that writing a Sherlock 3 plugin is an order of magnitude more complicated than for Sherlock 2.</p>

<p>You'll want to grab the Project Builder <a href="http://developer.apple.com/macosx/sherlock/">Sherlock Dev Kit</a> from Apple to work on this, and of course Jaguar 10.2.</p>

<p>Open this page in a web browser (nor Project Builder) then go ahead and try the <a href="sherlock://finkdev.dnsalias.net/fink/SherlockChannel.xml?action=add">Sherlock 3 Plugin for Fink</a>!</p>

<H3>Set Up The Channel Build Environment</H3><OL>	<LI><B>Copy this Project to A Web Server</B>

<p>Every channel must be hosted by a web server. This can be any http server, including any Mac OS X machine running Personal Web Server.
<p>Some possible locations:<font face="Courier" size=2><table border=1 cellPadding=5><tr bgcolor="lightBlue">	<td>Path</td>	<td>Base URL</td></tr><tr>	<td>/Library/WebServer/Documents/</td>	<td>http://localhost/</td></tr><tr>	<td>&lt;your home directory&gt;/Sites/</td>	<td>http://localhost/~yourUserName/</td></tr><tr>	<td>&lt;your iDisk&gt;/Sites/</td>	<td>http://homepage.mac.com/&lt;iDiskUserName&gt;/</td></tr></table></font>	<BR>
If you choose to use your local machine as a the host server (the first two options listed), you will need to turn on Personal Web Server. Open the Sharing panel of System Preferences and make sure "Personal Web Sharing" is checked.

	<LI><B>Launch Sherlock in Debug Mode</B><BR>The Project Builder project for the Sherlock Channel template is set up to run Sherlock as the execution environment. When Sherlock is opened by selecting Run Executable from Project Builder's Debug menu, the <code>SHERLOCK_DEBUG_CHANNELS</code> environment variable is set to 1, enabling a channel debugging mode. This enables a Debug menu within Sherlock, and also enables debug messages to be sent from JavaScript and XQuery to the Console.</LI>	<BR>	<LI><B>Adding The Channel To Sherlock's Toolbar</B><BR>Typically, users will add your channel to their toolbar by clicking a <code>sherlock://</code> URL from a web page or an email sent to them. You can add this channel by typing in a link to the channel's xml file in a popular browser, and hitting return. The URL will depend on where you put the channel. For example, a URL for a channel hosted in the <code>/Library/WebServer/Documents/</code> folder might look like...<p>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	<code>sherlock://localhost/MyChannel/SherlockChannel.xml?action=add</code></LI></OL><br><br><H3>Running The Channel</H3>
<ul>This sample channel is designed to accept a full URL, and create a list of results which are all the links on the page associated with the URL. As a search result is clicked on, it's contents are displayed in the HTML view below. Note that the HTML view does not support all the latest HTML formats.</ul><br><br><H3>Customizing The Channel</H3><OL>	<LI><B>Channel Identifier</B><BR>Each channel must have a unique identifier, in the style of JavaScript naming. This identifier is specified in the SherlockChannel.xml file.</LI>	<BR>	<LI><B>Channel Name</B><BR>The channel name is located in the /Channel/en.lproj/LocalizedResources.plist file.</LI>	<BR>	<LI><B>Channel Icon</B><BR>The channel icon can be either a .tiff or a .icns file. The path to the icon is specified in the SherlockChannel.xml file.</LI></OL>
<ul>Note that once you make a change to the channel, you can either quit/re-open Sherlock or reload the channel using Sherlock's Debug menu.
