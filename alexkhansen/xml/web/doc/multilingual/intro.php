<h1>i18n - 1 Introduction</h1>
    
    
    <h2><a name="what">1.1 What is going on with internationalization of the Fink website?</a></h2>
      
      <p>The Fink project has undertaken an effort to add full internationalization 
support to its website, in order to make the site more accessible 
worldwide.  Thanks to Baba Yoshihiko, there is now a framework in 
which pages in multiple languages can be employed
</p>
    
    <h2><a name="languages">1.2 Languages</a></h2>
      
      <p>We currently have volunteers working on the following languages:
</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Danish</li>
        <li>Dutch</li>
        <li>English (the baseline documentation)</li>
        <li>French</li>
        <li>German</li>
        <li>Italian</li>
        <li>Japanese</li>
        <li>Spanish</li>
        <li>Simplified Chinese</li>
      </ul>
    
    <h2><a name="organization">1.3 Organization</a></h2>
      
      <p>The Fink I18n team is organized as follows.</p>
    
    <h2><a name="helping">1.4 Helping out.</a></h2>
      
      <p>If you wish to help out with the internationalization effort, there are several things that you can do:
</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Join discussions on the fink-i18n mailing list. This is where we will discuss the mechanics of internationalization, announcements of updates to documents will be made, etc.


</li>
        <li>Look over the translation for your own language. You may have a translation that flows better than does the official one, you may find a translation error, and other possibilities.</li>
        <li>Become a translator yourself. If your language isn't currently represented (or even if it is), and you think you can provide an effective translation, then you may want to volunteer to be a translator for your language.
    <p>Be advised, however, if you are the first person to work on your language: there are quite a few documents that you will have to translate initially. Once this is done, there typically will be small changes made.</p>
          <p>To be a translator you need to:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Register for an account at SourceForge.</li>
            <li>Send a message to the fink-18n mailing list, letting them 
know your SourceForge username. Somebody there will make the arrangements 
for you to have CVS access to the documentation section.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
