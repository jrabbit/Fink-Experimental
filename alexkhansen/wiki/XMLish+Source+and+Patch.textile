All the <code>*Source*</code>-related fields are a pain to parse, can lead to a messy .info.<pre><code>SourceFile: <<
  Source: http://whatever
  Rename: %n-%v.tar.gz
  MD5: whatever
<<
SourceFile2: <<
  Source: http://whatever
  Rename: %n-%v.tar.gz
  MD5: whatever
<<</code></pre>cluster all fields for a given source object. Easy to add new features (dmalloc wants stronger checksums) without making even more of a top-level fieldname mess.

Easy to extend to patchfiles ("MD5 for patchfiles" is a longstanding request).<pre><code>PatchFile: <<
  Source: foo.patch
  MD5: whatever
<<
PatchFile2: <<
  Source: foo-ssl.patch
  MD5: whatever
<<</code></pre>The full path to each file would be available as a %-exp and <code>%a</code> would be abolished. That way only files that have passed the MD5 check would be usable.

_vasi:_
It would be nice to have a patch folder per package rather than one monster patch.

_dmacks:_
This is already possible (subdirs in %a), and I expect that way would continue to work correctly with the new syntax. One can already even cluster [.info and its .patch] in its own %n subdir.
