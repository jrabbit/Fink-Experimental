Here is the current plan for creating the 10.4 tree.

# We need to make sure that all packages using ==c++ or g++== have been tagged with the appropriate GCC field in 10.4-transitional.
** Status: This has been done in stable, but has been left to maintainers for unstable.
# We need to make sure that as many packages as possible with a GCC field will build OK using ==g++-4.0 rather than g++-3.3.==
** Status: This has been done in stable, and is being worked on for unstable.
# The new 10.4 tree will allow packages with GCC: 3.3, but a lot of care has to be taken with dependencies: putting such a package there means that all c++-using packages wihch depend on it must be GCC: 3.3 as well.  Packages which are put into the new tree as GCC: 3.3 should have some comment to this effect in the .info file.
** Status: comments are still being added in the stable tree.
** gcc 3.1 remnants: the following .info declare GCC:3.1
*** mutella
*** visual-py23
*** gnomemeeting
*** fxscintilla
*** brs
** The roo* packages already declare GCC:4.0 in the 10.4T tree
# Python 2.2 and all -py22 packages will NOT be brought forward to the 10.4 tree. (same for python21)

In addition to creating a 10.4 tree, we need a strategy for an upgrade for users when the tree changes.  The code in cirdan's dist-up-branch in CVS is one possible way to go.
