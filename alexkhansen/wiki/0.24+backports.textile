* InfoN validator patch *vasi please eyeball the patch in HEAD*
** I don't mind returning a different list based on wantarray, but I don't like that we actually *modify* the properties based on it. We're basically just special-casing handle_infon_block depending on whether or not it's being called by the validator, using wantarray as a confusing and indirect way to indicate that. If we're gonna special-case things, I'd rather just have a $validate option to handle_infon_block
