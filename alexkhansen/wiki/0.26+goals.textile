* more indexing work
** refactor into ==Indexer.pm== and possibly other modules
** load-on-demand
** version the DB
** forget_packages should have better options

* dep-engine refactoring work?

* External API (so scripts can 'use Fink')

* optimizations
** auto-split \PkgVersion?

* bug fixing!

* dist-upgrade?

* "Check version dependencies during package upgrade":https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=992093&group_id=17203&atid=117203 to avoid (or at least minimize) dep breakage. If foo-dev:depends:foo(=%v-%r), upgrading foo should (but does not currently) trigger an upgrade of foo-dev. Could use 'apt-get check' after each phase_activate to trigger additional pkg installations?
