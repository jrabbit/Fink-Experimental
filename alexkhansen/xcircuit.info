Description: Circuit drawing app with schematic capture
DescUsage: <<
 In some cases XCircuit uses cursors which are bigger than 16x16. In the
 current version of XFree86, this does not work in rootless mode. Hence
 you might want to switch to fullscreen mode when using xcircuit.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Had to add an extra -I/usr/X11R6/include to INCLUDES in Makefile.in to get the second compiler call to locate the X11 
libraries.
Needed to add -fno-common to CFLAGS
