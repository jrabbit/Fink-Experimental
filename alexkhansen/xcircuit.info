Description: Circuit drawing app with schematic capture
DescUsage: <<
 In some cases XCircuit uses cursors which are bigger than 16x16. In the
 current version of XFree86, this does not work in rootless mode. Hence
 you might want to switch to fullscreen mode when using xcircuit.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
 The upstream source is slightly broken (apparently Xw/Makefile.am was modified
 after Makefile.in was crated, hence automake wants to run). Cheating around
 this by touching Xw/Makefile.in
