* Overview

This set of scripts is intend to make all Fink packages, with Macs in Todai
Fink Team's lab ("Sodan room"). They are rough and inefficient -- they may or
may not work on your Macs :)

buildbox.sh creates a chroot environment, called buildbox. It is to protect
build environment from your casual use of Fink, or from accidental Apple's
software updates.

Thanks to buildbox, you can stop compile-time (maybe illegal) use of
/usr/bin/emacs. This behavor can be controled by editing
@BUILDBOX_ROOT@/buildbox.conf, where @BUILDBOX_ROOT@ is e.g. /buildbox .

Some software won't seem to work in chroot buildbox, like /Developer/Tools/Rez,
and /usr/bin/osacompile. buildbox.sh replaces them with some wrapper scripts.


* See also buildfink

There is more simple and clean set of scripts, called buildfink, written by
Matthew Sachs, a.k.a. msachs in #Fink. You can obtain it from Fink CVS. See:
http://fink.cvs.sourceforge.net/fink/scripts/buildfink/


* How to use

You may want /sw/bin/rsync installed.

To create buildbox:
  ./buildbox.sh create /path/to/buildbox

First you may want to install Fink into buildbox:
  ./buildbox.sh finkbootstrap /path/to/buildbox

To update buildbox (probablly after cvs update):
  ./buildbox.sh update /path/to/buildbox

Before you start build, you have to mount some partition such as /dev:
  ./buildbox.sh mount /path/to/buildbox

To enter buildbox:
  ./buildbox.sh chroot /path/to/buildbox
or just execute chroot:
  chroot /path/to/buildbox

Inside buildbox, you can start fink-build-forever script:
  /usr/local/admin/fink-build-forever.bash [-skipto pkg]

If you forget everything, just execute it to get help:
  ./buildbox.sh


* How they are actually set up

seri: Mac with Apache web server, mod_proxy_reverse enabled
nadeshiko: 10.4 PPC Mac, behind firewall
kikyo: 10.4 Intel Mac, behind firewall
nazuna: 10.3 PPC Mac, behind firewall

seri's httpd.conf have such statements like these:

  # Reverse proxy for build reports
  ProxyPass "/build-10.3" "http://nazuna/build"
  ProxyPass "/build-10.4-powerpc" "http://nadeshiko/build"
  ProxyPass "/build-10.4-i386" "http://kikyo/build"
  ProxyPassReverse "/build-10.3" "http://nazuna/build"
  ProxyPassReverse "/build-10.4-powerpc" "http://nadeshiko/build"
  ProxyPassReverse "/build-10.4-i386" "http://kikyo/build"
  
  # Reverse proxy for actual files
  ProxyPass "/apt/10.3/dists" "http://nazuna/10.3"

seri has also NFS, configured by /etc/exports:
  /Volumes/pub -ro -maproot=nobody -network=192.168.1.0 -mask=255.255.255.0

nadeshiko, kikyo and nazuna have also Apache running, with
/etc/httpd/httpd.conf having these lines:

  Alias "/build" "/buildbox/var/log/fink-build-forever"
  <Directory "/buildbox/var/log/fink-build-forever">
      Options All +Indexes -ExecCGI
      ForceType text/plain
  </Directory>

  # nadeshiko and kikyo have 10.4 distribution
  Alias "/10.4" "/buildbox/sw/fink/10.4"
  # nazuna has 10.3 distribution
  Alias "/10.3" "/buildbox/sw/fink/10.3"
