Fink X11 startup framework needs to replace following file:
$target
to a copy of following file:
$master

If you customized it and don't want it to be replaced, say no here and
modify it properly. Note that you can achieve many of what you want
via some hooks in $fink_prefix/bin/xinitrc.sh. Alternatively, you can
also bypass our standard mechanism by creating following file.
$fink_prefix/etc/xinitrc-override

If you don't know what all of this is about, just say yes.
