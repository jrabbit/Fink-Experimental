Description: Shared library build helper, v1.5
DescDetail: <<
GNU libtool knows how to build shared libraries on a wide range of
platforms. It is designed to work with autoconf to add painless shared
library support to GNU packages.

libtool 1.4 was a major change - it is now fully integrated with
autoconf. Converting packages is non-trivial and many still use 1.3.5,
therefore the new version is a separate package.

libtool-1.5 fully supports darwin, there is a patch to disable detection
of dlcompat if it is installed, as libltdl now uses native loading functions.
<<
DescPort: <<
Supports Darwin out of the box, the patches for Mac OS X 10.2 have
been merged into the upstream release.

Uses a 'g' prefix to avoid a naming conflict with Apple's libtool
program (which is completely unrelated).
