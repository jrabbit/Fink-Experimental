Description: Embeddable SQL database engine
Descdetail: <<
SQLite is a C library that implements an embeddable SQL database engine. 
Programs that link with the SQLite library can have SQL database access 
without running a separate RDBMS process. The distribution comes with a 
standalone command-line access program (sqlite) that can be used to 
administer an SQLite database and which serves as an example of how to 
use the SQLite library.

SQLite is not a client library used to connect to a big database server. 
SQLite is the server. The SQLite library reads and writes directly to and 
from the database files on disk.
