DescPackaging: Previous versions by Christoph Pfisterer.
DescPort: <<
This is just a repackaging of apt 0.5.4-52 for just the shared libs,
for backwards-compatibility purposes.

The original DescPort is as follows:

There are three troublemakers when porting apt:
- It was written for Linux/ELF/glibc.
- It was written to maintain a distribution that is in charge of the
  system and hardcodes paths like /usr/bin, /usr/lib and /var/lib.
- There is no install target in the Makefiles because the Debian
  packaging files take care of what goes where.
There's also the usual trouble like not recognizing Darwin and
depending on a case-sensitive file system. All of this amounts to a
big, bad patch.

The patch also fixes some potential and some real crashing bugs.

Oh, one more thing: mmap() is broken for non-trivial uses in OS X
10.1. Luckily apt uses a wrapper class that can be equipped with a
workaround (malloc() + read() + write()...).

The -fno-rtti works around a bug in GCC 3.1 on Jaguar.

Ben Hines - added patch to make apt recognize macosx and darwin pkgs

The sources.list file is now supplied by the fink program rather than
by apt-get.

The type of the fifth parameter for getsocklen keeps changing. The
original code uses unsigned int, which was never correct for darwin,
so we patch several choices. Through OS X 10.3, it was int; starting
in 10.4 it is socklen_t, a symbol that first appeared in 10.3 but was
an int. So starting in 10.3 we can just use socklen_t.
See: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=323716

dmacks - Implemented "--ignore-breakage" cmdline flag to 'apt-get install'
(first appears in: 10.2-gcc3.3/0.5.4-41, 10.3/0.5.4-51)
