Description: A themeing engine for KDE startup
DescDetail: <<
KSplash/ML offers a highly configurable splash screen for
KDE desktops.  Unlike the standard KDE Splash Screen
(KSplash), this program offers multiple appearances, and
now supports a highly customizable theming engine.

Initially, this program was designed to offer a
"Macintosh"-like splash screen (the "Standard" mode is the
oldest part of the program), but as time has progressed,
I've expanded and extended the software to be able to do
more, such as emulate a REAL Macintosh (instead of my
pseudo-Mac Standard mode), and emulate a Windows XP system. 
<<
DescPort: <<
NOTE: KDE packages do *not* have an -shlibs because of KDE's use of  
libltdl!  The .la's *must* be used in conjunction with the dynamic
libraries, and they are unversioned filenames, so multiple -shlibs would
conflict.
