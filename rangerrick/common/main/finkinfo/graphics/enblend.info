Description: 
DescDetail: <<
 Enblend is a tool for compositing images.  Given a set of images that overlap in
 some irregular way, Enblend overlays them in such a way that the seam between the
 images is invisible, or at least very difficult to see.  Enblend does not line
 up the images for you.  Use a tool like Hugin to do that.
