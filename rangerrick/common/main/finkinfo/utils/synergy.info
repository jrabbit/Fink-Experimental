Description: Share keyboard/mouse/clipboard with other computers
DescDetail: <<
Synergy lets you easily share a single mouse and keyboard between
multiple computers with different operating systems, each with its
own display, without special hardware.  It's intended for users
with multiple computers on their desk since each system uses its
own monitor(s).

Redirecting the mouse and keyboard is as simple as moving the
mouse off the edge of your screen.  Synergy also merges the
clipboards of all the systems into one, allowing cut-and-paste
between systems.  Furthermore, it synchronizes screen savers so
they all start and stop together and, if screen locking is
enabled, only one screen requires a password to unlock them all.
