Description: "tun" interface for Mac OS X
DescDetail: <<
The tunnel kernel extension provides the interfaces necessary for
running certain VPNs and network tunneling programs on Mac OS X.
Examples for such programs include VTun, OpenVPN, and various
PPTP implementations.  While the so-called tun driver is standard
on the BSD line of operating systems and the source code is
actually present in the Darwin source code repository, Apple
doesn't build it into the Mac OS X kernels.
