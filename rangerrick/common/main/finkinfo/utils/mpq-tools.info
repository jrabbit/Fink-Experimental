DescDetail: <<
MPQ, or MoPaQ, is a proprietary archive format created by
Mike O'Brien, the man hailed as Blizzard's multiplayer engine
genius, back in 1996 as a general purpose archive for use
with Diablo, and named narcissistically for its creator -
"Mike O'brien PaCK".  The copyrights to it, however, are held
by Havas Interactive, Blizzard's parent company.  The archive
format is used by many Blizzard titles like Diablo, Diablo 2,
Starcraft, Warcraft 2: BNE or a newer version in Warcraft 3.
