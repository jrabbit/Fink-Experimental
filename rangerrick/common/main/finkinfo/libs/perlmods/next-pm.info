DescDetail: <<
NEXT.pm adds a pseudoclass named NEXT to any program that uses it.
If a method m calls $self->NEXT::m(), the call to m is redispatched
as if the calling method had not originally been found.

In other words, a call to $self->NEXT::m() resumes the depth-first,
left-to-right search of $self's class hierarchy that resulted in the
original call to m.
