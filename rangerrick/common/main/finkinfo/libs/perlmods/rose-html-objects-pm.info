DescDetail: <<
The Rose::HTML::Object::* family of classes represent HTML tags, or
groups of tags.  These objects allow HTML to be arbitrarily
manipulated, then serialized to actual HTML (or XHTML).  Currently,
the process only works in one direction.  Objects cannot be
constructed from their serialized representations.  In practice,
given the purpose of these modules, this is not an important limitation.

Any HTML tag can theoretically be represented by a
Rose::HTML::Object-derived class, but this family of modules was
originally motivated by a desire to simplify the use of HTML forms.
