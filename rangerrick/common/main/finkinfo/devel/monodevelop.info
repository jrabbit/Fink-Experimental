DescDetail: <<
MonoDevelop is a project to port SharpDevelop to Gtk#.  There are numerous
goals that MonoDevelop hopes to achieve.  Some of these are:
* To create a best of breed development environment for Unix systems for
  C# and Mono.
* Since its written in Gtk#, and we like Gtk# and we get good support from
  Gtk#, most likely it will add functionality to improve the Gtk# experience.
* To drift as little as possible from the main SharpDevelop: we want ideally
  to merge the code back (through ifdefs, conditional compilation,
  interfaces, whatever) to maximize the contributions and maximize the
  development speed.
* Today the IDE is a simple IDE and on Unix does not do GUI design (that is
  limited to SharpDevelop), but we want to add a GUI designer.
* We want to integrate the tools we have been building so far, so things
  like MonoDoc, NUnit-Gtk and the debugger should target MonoDevelop.
