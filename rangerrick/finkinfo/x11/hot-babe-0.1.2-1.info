Description: NC-17 CPU meter
DescDetail: <<
Hot-babe is a small graphical utility which display the system activity
in a very special way.  When the CPU is idle, it displays a dressed
girl, and when the activity goes up, as the temperature increases, the
girl begins to undress, to finish totally naked when the system activity
reaches 100%.  Of course, if you can be shocked by nudity, don't use it!
