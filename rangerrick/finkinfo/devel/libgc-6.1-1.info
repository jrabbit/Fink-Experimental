DescDetail: <<
The Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector can be used as a
garbage collecting replacement for C malloc or C++ new. It is also used
by a number of programming language implementations that use C as
intermediate code.

Alternatively, it may be used as a leak detector for C or C++ programs,
though that is not its primary goal.
