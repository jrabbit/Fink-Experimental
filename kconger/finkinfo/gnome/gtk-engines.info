Description: Theme plugins for Gtk
DescDetail: <<
Install this package to use themes with Gtk. Theme engines are loaded
by Gtk at runtime. This package contains the metal, notif, redmond95
and pixmap engines, each with an associated default theme.
<<
DescPort: <<
Uses autoconf and libtool - the usual fixes.

Using themes can crash some GNOME apps. This includes the panel, which
is automatically restarted (only to crash again). As a last resort,
rename or remove the .gtkrc file in your home directory.
