This directory contains experimental versions of fink packages.

The most common change needed will be to force the use of the gcc 3.3 compiler
rather than a later compiler.  For the most part, though, this can be done
within the 10.3 tree itself.

A second common change is to use perl 5.8.6 rather than perl 5.8.1.  Sometimes
this requires a new version of a package.

A third change is a patch for wchar.h.

In this file, we'll keep track of packages which should not be moved forward
from 10.3; packages which should not be backported from here to 10.3; and
packages which are currently broken.

Packages which should not be moved from 10.3 to this directory:
 perl586

Packages which should not be moved from this directory to 10.3:
 perl581 (not perfect: had to disable "make test")
 gcc3.1 (functional if -no-cpp-precomp is passed)

Packages which are currently broken:
 mysql-4.1.7-11, from unstable (mysql-4.0.17-11 in stable is OK, however)
