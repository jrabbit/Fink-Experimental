 TestScript: <<
  # Test 91 fails when run as root because it depends on permission settings
  # that are ignored by root. It's SUPPOSED to fail but doesn't because root
  # is all-powerful. It works properly with --build-as-nobody, but we can't
  # use that because of our funky CompileScript.

Description: Archiving program for files and tape
DescPackaging: <<
 With the current fink dependency engine, essential packages may neither
 depend nor builddepend on non-essential packages.  Thus, to make sure
 that non-essential splitoffs of essential packages (like gettext-bin
 and *-dev) are present at build time, we call 'fink install' during
 the compile script.  Note that since the corresponding essential packages
 are dependencies of this one, they should already have been built, so
 'fink install' should merely make sure they are in place.
