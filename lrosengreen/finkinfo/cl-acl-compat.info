DescDetail: << 
acl-compat is a library that implements parts of the Allegro Common
Lisp (ACL) API for areas that are not covered by the ANSI Common Lisp
standard itself (e.g. sockets, threading).  The motivation for
creating and maintaining acl-compat is to get the web server
AllegroServe (that was released by Franz Inc under the LLGPL) running
on a wide range of Lisp implementations, with as few source changes to
its core code as possible.

Stilll a little rough around the edges :)

%p --> where your fink installation is located (ie /sw)
%type_pkg[lisp] --> lisp implementation you are using (ie openmcl)
