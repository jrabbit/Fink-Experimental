DescDetail: <<
  A free ANSI Common Lisp implementation for the Macintosh with
  several advanced features including native (POSIX) threading,
  support for most of AMOP, and an elegant interface to
  Objective-C/Cocoa.

  Note: this is the 32 bit version of OpenMCL.  The 64 bit (G5) version
  is not currently available through fink
<< 

DescPackaging: << 
  * Derived from the DarwinPorts package for OpenMCL originally
    created by Gregory Wright

  * OpenMCL.app is not a normal application.  It is part of OpenMCL's
    support for Cocoa, and needs to go in %p/lib/%n/ccl.

  * The darwinppc-all distribution combines what was
    previously several separate downloads.

  * There is a lot of good documentation in the lisp source files.  I
    think it is better to keep them instead of removing them.
    
  * OpenMCL has a 64bit version for the G5.  Ideally, this package
    should eventually be split into two packages, one for the 32 bit
    version, and a package for the 64 bit G5 version.
  
  * OpenMCL is not ready for intel, for the reasons described here:
