DescDetail: << 
SISC is an extensible Java based interpreter of the algorithmic
language Scheme.  SISC uses modern interpretation techniques, and
handily outperforms all existing JVM interpreters (often by more than
an order of magnitude).

In addition, SISC is a complete implementation of the language. The
entire R5RS Scheme standard is supported, no exceptions. This includes
a full number tower including complex number support, arbitrary
precision integers and floating point numbers, as well as hygenic R5RS
macros, proper tail recursion, and first-class continuations (not just
the escaping continuations as in many limited Scheme systems). SISC
also attempts to implement the standard as correctly as possible,
while still providing exceptional performance.

SISC also provides useful real-world extensions, such as networking,
elegant exception handling, a scope-friendly module system, support
for SLIB, numerous SRFIs, and an extensible type system with a Java
foreign-function interface.

Finally, native functionality can be added through the use of native
libraries that may add new types, values, and functions to the
language. These extensions can be packaged into scopable modules at
the Scheme level as well.
