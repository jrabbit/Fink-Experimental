DescDetail: << 
UFFI is a package to interface Common Lisp programs
with C-language compatible libraries. Every Common Lisp implementation
has a method for interfacing to such libraries. Unfortunately, these
method vary widely amongst implementations. Without the use of UFFI,
to support multiple implementations, developers must write a different
interface library for each Common Lisp implementation.

UFFI gathers a common subset of functionality between Common Lisp
implementations. UFFI wraps this common subset of functionality with
it's own syntax and provides macro translation of UFFI functions into
the specific syntax of supported Common Lisp implementations.
