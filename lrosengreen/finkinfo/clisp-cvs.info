DescDetail: <<
A feature loaded common lisp programming environment with unicode
support, excellent ANSI compliance, a full-featured MOP.  CLISP has
the ability (at least in theory) to work with lisp images larger than
4 gigabytes on machines with a 64bit processor (untested on the G5).

This package pulls and builds source from clisp's CVS source code
repository.
<<

DescUsage: <<
Type "clisp" at a shell prompt to start clisp.  If you wish to use
one of clisp's add-on modules, you should use "clisp -K modulename"
instead, or "clisp -K full" to load all available modules.

The following add-on modules are currently built by this package:
MIT-CLX  - Low level interface to X11

To pull the latest changes from CVS and rebuild this package, type
"fink rebuild clisp-cvs" at a shell promp.

The source code cache created in %p/var/cache/fink/clisp-cvs.cache
can be safely deleted whenever you wish.  The package will regenerate
it as needed.

DescPackaging: <<
14Jan2005: REGEXP, I18N and SYSCALLS moved into base image upstream

10Mar2005: Dynamic FFI works now.

04Apr2005: modules/syscalls/calls.c calls setprgp() with no arguments.
           This function on OS X expects two arguments.
