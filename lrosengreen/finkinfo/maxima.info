DescDetail: <<
Maxima is a descendant of the symbol manipulation program Macsyma, 
which had its roots in the late 1960s at MIT. Its abilities include 
basic algebraic manipulation, symbolic integration, 2D and 3D plotting, 
and an ODE solver. 
<<

DescUsage: <<
If you have trouble installing with Fink Commander, try installing from
the command line (and don't divert the output to a file).

Enter "maxima" to get a command line interface, and "xmaxima" to get a
graphical interface under xwindows.
<<

DescPackage: <<
Until I find a good way to deal with the stale fasl/core/image
problem, this should not be moved to unstable because any time the
lisp that is depended on is updated to a new version, this package has
to be rebuilt.

todo: 
* need to use a CVS snapshot for CMUCL and SBCL to work
  correctly (need a more recent defsystem.lisp, I think)
