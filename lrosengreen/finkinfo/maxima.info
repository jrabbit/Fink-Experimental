DescDetail:<<
Maxima is a descendant of the symbol manipulation program Macsyma, 
which had its roots in the late 1960s at MIT. Its abilities include 
basic algebraic manipulation, symbolic integration, 2D and 3D plotting, 
and an ODE solver. 
<<
DescUsage:<<
Enter "maxima" to get a command line interface, and "xmaxima" to get a
graphical interface under xwindows.
<<

DescPackaging: << 
To avoid incompatibilities between Maxima's dumped lisp image and
CLISP's kernel, any time the clisp package is updated, the Depends: and
Revision: lines of this package _must_also_ be updated in order to force
a rebuild.  If this is not done, it may lead to bizarre and difficult to
diagnose problems with Maxima.
