DescDetail: << 
Darcs is a revision control system, along the lines of CVS and arch.
That means that it keeps track of various revisions and branches of
your project, allows for changes to propagate from one branch to
another. Darcs is intended to be an ``advanced'' revision control
system.  Darcs has two particularly distinctive features which differ
from other revision control systems: 1) each copy of the source is a
fully functional branch, and 2) underlying darcs is a consistent and
powerful theory of patches.

DescPackaging: <<
This package is licensed under the GPL, but because the binary links
against OpenSSL, and therefore is not distributable, its license is listed
as restrictive. 

otool -L shows this is using OS X OpenSSL instead of fink's.  arrrgh.  I'll
need to experiment with passing some flags to ghc.
