DescDetail: << 
Darcs (David's Advanced Revision Control System) is a revision control
system, along the lines of CVS and arch.  That means that it keeps
track of various revisions and branches of your project, allows for
changes to propagate from one branch to another. Darcs is intended to
be an ``advanced'' revision control system.  Darcs has two
particularly distinctive features which differ from other revision
control systems: 1) each copy of the source is a fully functional
branch, and 2) underlying darcs is a consistent and powerful theory of
patches.
