DescDetail: << 
GCC-XML parses a C++ source file as it is seen by the compiler when it
is built.  An easy-to-parse XML representation of the class, function,
and namespace declarations is dumped to a specified file.  Full C pre-
processing transforms the file into a C++ translation unit as seen by
the compiler.  This means that GCC-XML should make use of the same
standard library and other header files as the compiler.  GCC-XML can
be configured to simulate any of several popular compilers.
