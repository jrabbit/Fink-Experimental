First off fink-libcheck's main idea came from fix-fink and in some ways is
just and extension of it.  Here are the original authors, all though no
code came from it, just the main idea.
  fix-fink was written by Max Horn <fingolfin@users.sourceforge.net> and
  David R. Morrison <dmrrsn@users.sourceforge.net>

fink-libcheck is property of the fink team and belongs to fink as such the
whole Fink team is the author and maintainer.  Any problems or usage questions
should be directed towards them.

Both fink and dpkg must be installed before using fink-libcheck, and it is
recommended that fink-libcheck be installed using fink itself.
   ("fink install fink-libcheck" would do it.)

Usage is easy, ie to find all readline.4.2 linked files type
   ("fink-libcheck readline.4.2")
to find all files linked against to old system lib type
   ("fink-libcheck libSystem.B")
or to get a list of depends you want to know everything linked against
readline type
   ("fink-libcheck readline")
