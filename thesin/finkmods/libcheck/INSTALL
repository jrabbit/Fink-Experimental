Both fink and dpkg must be installed before using fink-libcheck, and it is
recommended that fink-libcheck be installed using fink itself.
  ("fink install fink-libcheck" would do it.)

If you are installing from CVS, fink and dpkg still need be installed but for
a CVS install first make sure you have the latest version from CVS, change
directories to the cvsroot or fink-libcheck and type "./inject.pl".
