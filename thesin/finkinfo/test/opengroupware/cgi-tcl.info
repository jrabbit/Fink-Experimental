Description: CGI support library for Tcl programmers
DescDetail: <<
  cgi.tcl is the CGI support library for Tcl programmers. The library is very
  thorough - it supports forms, tables, cookies, file upload, plug-ins,
  JavaScript, Netscape extensions, etc, etc. It also provides very
  convenient support for debugging and handling CGI errors.
  .
  cgi.tcl can also be used for generating static html (such as this page).
  This enables you to get programming features into HTML, such as variables,
  if/then/else, file I/O, etc. For example, HTML lacks variables so if you
  repeatedly use a link on a page and one day the link changes, you've got
  to update every use of the link, possibly on hundreds of pages. By storing
  the link in a Tcl variable, you can just change the one place where the
  variable is defined. This makes maintenance much easier. This is just a
  tiny example of the benefits cgi.tcl provides.
