Description: Tool to generate DNS data from LDAP
DescDetail: <<
  ldap2dns is a program to create DNS records directly from an LDAP database.
  It can and should be be used to replace the secondary name server by a
  second primary one. ldap2dns helps reduce all kinds of administration
  overhead. No more flat file editing, no more zone file editing. After
  having installed ldap2dns, the administrator only has to access the LDAP
  database. If she desires, she can add access control for each zone, create
  a special GUI, or use one of the existing LDAP GUIs and add all other kind
  of zone and resource record information without interfering with the DNS
  server. ldap2dns is designed to write an ASCII data file used by tinydns
  (from the djbdns package), or a zonename.db -file as used by named.
