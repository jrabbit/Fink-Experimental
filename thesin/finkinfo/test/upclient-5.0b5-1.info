Description: Collects system uptime and display it on http://uptimes.wonko.com
DescDetail: <<
 The Uptimes Project is an attempt to collect data on system uptime
 (the amount of time a computer has been running since its last reboot)
 from various operating system and hardware configurations.
<<
DescUsage:<<
	1. Create a user here : http://uptimes.wonko.com/newuser.php?
	2. add a host, this gives you an auth key,
	3. copy it to /sw/etc/upclient.conf
	4. run 'daemonic enable upclient' as root, this will install a Startup Item
	5. to start reporting your uptimes :
		a) either reboot (easy (-:)
		b) or else, if this is a first time installation (or if you know no instance of upclient is running), run '/Library/StartupItems/daemonic-upclient/daemonic-upclient start' as root.

	To discontinue reporting, run 'daemonic disable upclient' as root. This will
not kill a running instance at this time. Reboot the machine to get rid of it, or run " kill `cat /sw/var/run/upclient.pid` " as root.

 PS : the web site used to report the OS as 5.2,
 this is fixed since March 10th, 2002
