Description: Plam OS Emulator
DescDetail: <<
  Palm OS Emulator is an application that emulates the hardware for most
  Palm Computing Platform Hardware devices (e.g., Pilot, PalmPilot, Palm
  III, Palm V, Palm VII, etc.).  The Emulator runs on most standard
  desktop computers, includes those running Windows 95, Windows 98,
  Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Mac OS 8.6, Mac OS 9.x, Mac OS X, and
  several flavors of Unix.  On the Mac, you need CarbonLib 1.2.5 or later.
  .
  With the Palm OS Emulator, you can emulate the functions of a Palm
  hardware device, including running the built-in application, as well as
  installing and running 3rd party applications.
  .
  Palm OS Emulator is an Open Source project.  That means that the source
  code is available for you to peruse and modify.  If you make any changes
  that you think might benefit others, we urge you to consider sending
  them back to Palm, Inc., for inclusion in the main source code base.
