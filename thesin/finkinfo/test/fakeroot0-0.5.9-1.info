Description: Gives a fake root environment
DescDetail: <<
  Fakeroot runs a command in an environment were it appears to have root
  privileges for file manipulation, by setting LD_PRELOAD to a library with
  alternative versions of getuid(), stat(), etc. This is useful for allowing
  users to create archives (tar, ar, .deb .rpm etc.) with files in them with
  root permissions/ownership. Without fakeroot one would have to have root
  privileges to create the constituent files of the archives with the correct
  permissions and ownership, and then pack them up, or one would have to
  construct the archives directly, without using the archiver.
