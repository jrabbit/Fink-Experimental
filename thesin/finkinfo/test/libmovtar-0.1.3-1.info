Description: Library that implements the movtar MJPEG video format
DescDetail: <<
  libmovtar
  ---------

  has been implemented according to the quicktime4linux API
  (see http://heroine.linuxave.net/quicktime.html ).

  It supports reading and writing (read/write mode has been prepared,
  but is not implemented yet) of MJPEG video in YUV 4:2:2 JPEG
  with mono/stereo, 8/16-bit, any sample rate sound.

  It supports indexing files (always done when writing a new file,
  old (or manually created) movtar files without index are indexed
  internally during the opening process).

  You can freely jump forwards and backwards between the frames
  in an opened file.

  movtar_tools
  ------------

  They are there to help you understand the principles behind
  the movtar format, and do special tasks which aren't
  possible with the library (like movtar_index, which
  _removes_ a video index, for experimental and debugging
  purposes). Please see the respective help information
  (e.g. movtar_index -h) for more details.
