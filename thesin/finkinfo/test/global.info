Description: Source code search and browse tools
DescDetail: <<
  GLOBAL is a source code tag system that works the same way across
  diverse environments. Currently, it supports the following:

    o command line, and the 'globash' query subshell.
    o vim plugin, and support for other vi clones.
    o less
    o emacs
    o web browser

  Supported languages are C/C++ Yacc and Java.
  You can locate a specified function in the source files and move
  there easily. It is especially useful for hacking large projects
  containing many subdirectories, many '#ifdef' and many main()
  functions, like X or kernel source.

  This package include the htmake(1) extension which allows GLOBAL's
  hypertext search function to be implemented from a single central
  cgi script.

  Doxygen now supports using global as its source browser, with the
  USE_HTAGS option.
