Description: Search and AutoSearch and WebSearch
DescDetail: <<
WWW::Search is a collection of Perl modules which provide an API to
search engines on the world-wide web (and similar engines).
Currently, WWW::Search includes backends for WebCrawler, among others.
Backends for many engines can be obtained separately, such as
AltaVista, Ebay, HotBot, and Yahoo.  This distribution includes two
applications built from this library: AutoSearch, a program to
automate tracking of search results over time; and WebSearch, a small
demonstration program to drive the library.

WWW::Search does NOT try to emulate the default search that you would
get with each search engine's GUI.  I.e. WWW::Search does NOT
necessarily return the same results you would get by visiting the
search engine's web page.  A few backends implement the method
gui_query which does get the same results as searches from the
engine's default web page; see `perldoc WWW::Search` for details.  See
also below under FUTURE PLANS.  WWW::Search performs the search in a
way that is efficient and convenient for text processing.  This might
include using the "advanced search" interface; getting "text-only"
pages; making "OR" the default query term operator instead of "AND";
ungrouping same-site results; making sure descriptions are turned on;
and increasing the number of hits per page, among other tricks.

Because WWW::Search depends on parsing the HTML output of web search
engines, it will fail if the search engine operators change their
format (an unfortunately frequent occurrence).  WWW::Search includes a
test suite for a few backends, which verifies that they are
functioning correctly.  The test suite can be run by typing 'make
test_parsing'; see under INSTALLATION below for details.

This base WWW::Search distribution contains backends for the following
search engines.  Unfortunately, almost none are operational.  We would
like to have volunteers to fix and/or take over maintenance of these
backends.

Crawler                 not working
ExciteForWebServers     not working
Fireball                partially working (not in test suite)
FolioViews              not working
Gopher                  not working? (not in test suite)
HotFiles                not working
Livelink                not working? (not in test suite)
MetaCrawler             not working?
Metapedia               partially working? (not in test suite)
MSIndexServer           not working?
NetFind                 not working?
Null                    working
PLweb                   not working
Profusion               defunct
Search97                not working
SFgate                  partially working?
Simple                  not working? (not in test suite)
Verity                  not working (not in test suite)
VoilaFr                 partially working? (not in test suite)

''Partially working'' indicates that some tests passed and some failed.
