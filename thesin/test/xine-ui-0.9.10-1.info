Description: Xine video player, user interface
DescDetail: <<
This is an X11 based GUI for the libxine video player library.
It provides xine, a skin based media player that can play all the
audio/video formats that libxine supports. Currently, this includes MPEG1/2,
some AVI and Quicktime files, some network streaming methods and disc based
media (VCD, SVCD, DVD). A more complete list can be found on
http://xine.sf.net/.

This package contains an additional frontend, aaxine, which runs even on the
console. aaxine uses aalib to render ASCII art video, or you can tell it to
use a framefuffer device. This is more a proof of concept, but you can use it
to watch DVDs on your old vt100 terminal, of course. ;-)

Most DVDs on the market today are play-protected by the Content Scrambling
System (CSS). Xine does not provide any code to descramble those DVDs,
because of legal uncertainties.
