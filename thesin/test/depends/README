fink-depends is property of the fink team and belongs to fink as such the
whole Fink team is the author and maintainer.  Any problems or usage questions
should be directed towards them.

Both fink and dpkg must be installed before using fink-depends, and it is
recommended that fink-depends be installed using fink itself.  It also requires
the use of otool which is provided by the apple developpers tools.
   ("fink install fink-depends" would do it.)

Usage is easy, ie to find all depends for readline type
   ("fink-depends readline")

The output will be a line you'll be able to simply cut and paste into your
fink info file.
