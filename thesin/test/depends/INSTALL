Both fink and dpkg must be installed before using fink-depends, and it is
recommended that fink-depends be installed using fink itself.  It will also
require otool which is included in the apple developpers tools.
  ("fink install fink-depends" would do it.)

If you are installing from CVS, fink and dpkg still need be installed but for
a CVS install first make sure you have the latest version from CVS, change
directories to the cvsroot or fink-depends and type "./inject.pl".
