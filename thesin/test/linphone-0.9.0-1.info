Description: SIP-compatible Web phone with a GNOME interface
DescDetail: <<
Linphone is a Web phone with a GNOME interface. It let you make two-party
calls over IP networks such as the Internet. It uses the IETF protocols
SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) and RTP (Realtime Transport Protocol)
to make calls, so it should be able to communicate with other SIP-based
Web phones. With several codecs available, it can be used with high speed
connections as well as 28k modems.
