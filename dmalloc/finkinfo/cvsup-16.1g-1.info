Description: CVS-Optimized Network File Distribution System

DescDetail: <<
CVSup is a software package for distributing and updating collections of files 
across a network. It can efficiently and accurately mirror all types of files, 
including sources, binaries, hard links, symbolic links, and even device nodes. 
CVSup's streaming communication protocol and multithreaded architecture make it 
most likely the fastest mirroring tool in existence today.

CVSup was conceived and developed by John Polstra, a consultant whose specialties 
include high-performance network communications. 

In addition to being a great general-purpose mirroring tool, CVSup includes special
features and optimizations specifically tailored to CVS repositories.
