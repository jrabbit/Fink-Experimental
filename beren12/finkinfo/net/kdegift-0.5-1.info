Description: A KDE frontend for giFT
DescDetail: <<
The program builds on the work done by Robert Wittams on his Kadeau. The front end look about the same and is reused as much as possible. The back-end has been rewritten mostly. Searches that give a lot of results back are very slow at the moment.

Features:

 * Comfortable interface
 * Multiple searches
