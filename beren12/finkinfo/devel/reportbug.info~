Description: Reports bugs in the Fink distribution
DescDetail: <<
A tool designed to make the reporting of bugs in Debian
and derived distributions relatively painless.  Its features include:

 * Integration with the mutt, af, and mh/nmh mail readers.
 * Access to outstanding bug reports to make it easier to identify
   whether problems have already been reported.
 * Automatic checking for newer versions of packages.
 * Optional automatic verification of integrity of packages via debsums.
 * Support for following-up on outstanding reports.
 * Optional PGP/GnuPG integration.

reportbug is designed to be used on systems with an installed mail
transport agent, like exim or sendmail; however, you can edit the
configuration file and send reports using any available mail server.

If your system's users use locales with character sets other than
UTF-8 and ISO-8859-*, python2.3-cjkcodecs is required for proper
operation.
