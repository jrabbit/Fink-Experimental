Description: Decoder for Apple Lossless Audio  Codec files (ALAC)
DescDetail: <<
ALAC is a proprietary lossless audio compression  scheme. Apple never released any documents on the format.

What I provide here is a C implementation of a decoder, written  from reverse engineering the file format. It turns out that most  of the algorithms in the codec are fairly well known. ALAC uses  an adaptive FIR prediction algorithm and stores the error values  using a modified rice or golumb algorithm. Further details are in  alac.c.

Although an encoder is not provided, by using the decoder as a sort  of specification it should be fairly trivial to write an encoder.  By exploiting other lossless audio encoders, such as FLAC, the task  will be much easier. Although one wouldn't be able to copy  the compression algorithms verbatim,  as adaptive compression is used in ALAC and not in FLAC. There are,  however, a bunch of academic papers on the issue.
