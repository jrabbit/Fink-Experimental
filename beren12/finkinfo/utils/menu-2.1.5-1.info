Description: Provides update-menus functions for some applications
DescDetail: <<
The intent of this package is to streamline the menu's (like the
fvwm2 ones) in fink. For this purpose, menu provides an "update-menus"
command, that will read all installed menu files (as provided by
other packages in %p/lib/menu), and run the frontents for various
window-managers in %p/etc/menu-methods to create startup files for
the window managers (or pdmenu).

The user and system admin can easily override the menu files
on a by-user or by-system bases.
