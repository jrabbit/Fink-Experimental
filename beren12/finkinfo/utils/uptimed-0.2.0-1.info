Description: A utility to log computer uptimes
DescDetail: <<
An uptime record daemon keeping track of the highest uptimes a computer
system ever had. It uses the system boot time to keep sessions apart
from each other. Uptimed comes with a console front-end to parse the
records, which can also easily be used to show your records on a web 
page.
