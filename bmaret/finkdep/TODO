* Implement a faster way to find which package provides a library than
  using dpkg -S. We could use dlocate, or search in the .shlibs files
  in %p/var/lib/dpkg/info

* Try to reduce the number of dependencies: if spam depends on
  eggs-shlibs and bacon-shlibs, but eggs-shlibs itself depends on
  bacon-shlibs, then bacon-shlibs doesn't need to be listed as a
  Depends (but bacon-dev still needs to be listed as BuildDepends).
