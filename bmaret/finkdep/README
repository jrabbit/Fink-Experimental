Finkdep is a tool to find the Fink packages that provide the
dependencies of a program or a library. It is usefull to write Fink
packages for programs or libraries that have complex dependencies. It
uses otool to find the libraries on which depends the program or the
library, and search for the packages that provides these libraries by
looking at the .list files in %s/var/lib/dpkg/info/. It outputs the
Depends and BuildDepends in Info format, so one can just cut and paste
the output to write a Fink package.
