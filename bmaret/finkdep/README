Finkdep is a tool to find the Fink packages that provide the
dependencies of a program or a library. It is usefull to write Fink
packages for programs or libraries that have complex dependencies. It
uses otool to find the libraries on which depends the binary, and
search for the packages that provides these libraries with dpkg. It
outputs the Depends and BuildDepends in Info format, so one can just
cut and paste the output to write a Fink package.
