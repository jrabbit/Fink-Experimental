Description: Library for embedding symbolic manipulations
DescDetail: <<
  GiNaC is an iterated and recursive acronym for GiNaC is Not a CAS,
where CAS stands for Computer Algebra System. It is designed to allow
the creation of integrated systems that embed symbolic manipulations
together with more established areas of computer science (like
computation- intense numeric applications, graphical interfaces, etc.)
under one roof. It is distributed under the terms and conditions of
the GNU general public license (GPL).
  It has been specifically developed to become a replacement engine for
xloops which is up to now powered by the Maple CAS. However, it is not
restricted to high energy physics applications. Its design is
revolutionary in a sense that contrary to other CAS it does not try to
provide extensive algebraic capabilities and a simple programming
language but instead accepts a given language (C++) and extends it by
a set of algebraic capabilities.
