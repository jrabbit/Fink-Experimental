Description: Colorized diff wrapper
DescDetail: <<
  colordiff is a wrapper for diff and produces the same output as diff
but with coloured syntax highlighting at the command line to improve
readability. Theoutput is similar to how a diff-generated patch might
appear in Vim or Emacs with the appropriate syntax highlighting
options enabled. The colour schemes can be read from a central
configuration file or from a local user ~/.colordiffrc file.
  colordiff makes use of ANSI colours and as such will only work when
ANSI colours can be used - typical examples are xterms and Eterms, as
well as console sessions.
  colordiff has been tested on various flavours of Linux and under
OpenBSD, but should be broadly portable to other systems.
